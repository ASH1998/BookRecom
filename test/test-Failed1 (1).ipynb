      "I like how Anastasia and Christian love each other because everyone have a different way to love and they discovered and experienced new feelings but I felt it was a lot of sex and not much feelings. But the genere is erotic... so if you like erotic things this might be your book but if you like more feelings, love, words, etc... probably not.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book was horrible, starting from the dialac to the words used. First off there is no virgin in the world that would go directly into BDSM, second off they are both retarded they have been dancing around in circles the whole book and for what? To break up when they shouldve never been together?! Stupid.. And talk about insecure, anna is so damn annoying i mean my god do you have no back bone? And christian wdf is wrong with this guy? Its called therapy shit. And if i had a dollar evrytime annas \"inner godess\" said 'Holy fuck' i swear id be a millionaire.. Ughh dumb book idk why so many people like this series!\n",
      "\n",
      "I know this series has sparked some controversy... I've read some reviews about the book degrading women, etc., and yes - the book does break some boundaries into S&M - but if that sort of things offends you then in my opinion don't read it! \n",
      " Originally bought this book to read while on vacation in Cancun, and I have to say it was a struggle to read on the beach - but once I was back in the U.S. it was easier to focus and I ended up really enjoying the book. Bought the other two books and plan to finish the series soon!\n",
      "\n",
      "Not sure what all the fluster was all about? I decided to read this after my oldest daughter brought home a copy, she's 35. It was an engaging little tale, but I kept waiting for the controversial parts., and waiting, and waiting. Now true, my reading tastes are quite eclectic and my tolerance level for erotic has a high bar, but I found nothing in this book that went further than dozens of other books I've read. I enjoyed the story and may, or not, read the seqquels.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have read some erotica books in the past but I usually don't read them--not because I don't like them or think they are vulgar, it's just not a genre I generally seek out. I ended up reading this book to see what all the fuss was about and because the movie is coming out next year. After reading several reviews of the book, I had mixed feeling going into reading it, and figured I probably wouldn't like it. But I did end up enjoying it. The plot seemed interesting enough, and it held my attention, and was an easy read. I can understand why women like this book--there are some very sexy parts to this book. And who doesn't like the idea of having a rich man giving them lavish gifts and doting on them? I was surprised I liked this book as much as I did, and there were questions left unanswered at the end of the book. I didn't even second guess the idea of reading book two. All in all, a pretty good book, but I probably won't reread it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to deny the allure of this book simply because of the poor writing (although I've read much worse), yet there is something about it that is captivating. I can't explain it, but there's a bit of magic in this book that keeps you turning the page. Is it the introduction of this genre to the mainstream that initially shocks and then captivates? Is it the characters? I don't know, but it is undeniable reader's catnip at first read. I've tried, but the magic is lost on a second reading. And by no means do I think this is a book for every reader. If the topic makes you uncomfortable without cracking the cover, then this isn't a book for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "WOW! Hold on to your hats ladies...this book will blow your mind!\n",
      "\n",
      "Horrible. Boring. Dreadful. I had to FIGHT to pick up the book and read it. I never ended up finishing it. And I LOVE and WRITE erotic literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah.. No. Really not my thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I resisted reading this book for a long time. ultimately I broke down and read it. it's a junk novel that is easy reading. i wasn't intrigued or thrown off by the plot. Finished it pretty easy.\n",
      "\n",
      "writing left much to be desired. pun intended.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the first time a book has ever brought me to tears. It was so much more than just am erotic S&M romance. It forced me to confront my views on relationships and just what my lots would be. The author did a splendid job of showing how addicting an emotionally damaged person could be. The primal desires of man and woman was also an eye opener.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was just awful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fifty Shades of Grey is the most appalling, dull, poorly written, over hyped drivel I have had the misfortune to read. \n",
      " Clever, innocent student Ana(stasia) meets rich, successful Christian (Fifty Shades of) Grey and after a prolonged period of dancing about the issue, gets together with him despite his BDSM tendencies in some confusing, undefined sort of relationship. Continual angst about the viability of the relationship until the end of the book. \n",
      " All the while, Anastasia's flatmate Kate is merrily banging Christian's brother into next week. Oh, what a small world. \n",
      " Anastasia, as a lead character, is like a flat tyre as selling feature for a car. Necessary, functional, not designed for pleasure and when they go flat - utterly useless. The wittering woman is possibly the most annoying female lead in history. Her (crap/double crap/triple crap) ramblings are monotonous, repetitive and inane. She also apparently owns no clothes of her own. \n",
      " Worse than Anastasia is Anastasia's subconscious, apparently a character in her own right who dances, beckons, grins, frowns, sambas and other numerous forms of dancing, and eats grapes. Exactly why James thought it would be advantageous to describe Anastasia's feelings in terms of the behaviour of a schizophrenic shoulder angel is beyond me. \n",
      " Suffice to say, I wanted to smack Anastasia with the nearest belt too, mostly out of irritation. \n",
      " Christian Grey (or Fifty Shades as Anastasia inexplicably decides to call him) is equally unfathomable. It escapes me how anyone can fall in love with such a flat, two-dimensional, cold and impersonal character. Though, it also escapes me how he has managed to build a multi \"zillion\" dollar empire and successfully runs the business without ever actually going to the office or doing any actual work. Yet somehow, he has managed it. \n",
      " The initial will-they/won't-they is entirely undermined by the very premise of the book. Of course they will. Thereafter, \"negotiations\" commence as to how the Sub/Dom relationship will work. We are treated to reading the necessary contract not once, not twice, but three pigging times. Could James not have written \"the contract\" subsequently? And - just an aside - but who changes the subject line every time they reply to an email? That was very irritating. \n",
      " Built around the sex scenes, the so-called erotic fiction is about as erotic as throwing a pickled onion down the toilet and watching it decompose over a period of several weeks. Odd disgusting quirk aside, every encounter was pretty much the same which made them very boring very quickly. But congratulations to the author on mastering the art of copy-and-pasting. \n",
      " The mixed metaphors, inconsistencies and general diabolical writing (in present tense, though nobody knows why) continue for a long, drawn-out period of time until the ending finally arrives, rushed into about two pages.

      " Now to the highlights \n",
      " This book felt like someone(I won't name names) decided to live their sexual fantasies through a book. And that's okay. I don't shy away from explicit content. Most times, i just skim through it. The thing is, I just think there are some things that are just too fragile and intimate between a man and a woman to be bared out there like that- with no furnishing, what-so-ever. But, I went on to read book 2(which I didn't finish) after this. Why? Well, I have a delusional habit, I don't believe in lost causes. But thanks for stabbing me in the eye. \n",
      " Two One and half stars, because a little less on all things explicit, and a little more meat on the dialogue and plot, and this book would have taken fair form..maybe good form even. I mean God! I kept seeing potential; Lost boy wandering in the dark? Come on, who doesn't like a good tortured hero? There was a good concept working in the background there. In the end, Ana is the EXACT example of a girl you never want to be. And Christian - I want to cuss in nonsensical language. Why couldn't he meet a girl with a pitchfork, a sense of pride, and a little self-control instead? I get it, I really do, the heart wants what it wants, but I believe there's something to be said for self respect and dignity. I just think Christian and Ana's relationship was unhealthy, not because of the kind of relationship they established between themselves, but because of the way it was portrayed and handled. Outside the 'playroom', there should've been an established shift in dynamic that left room to accommodate a little thing called respect. Most of the things which transpired between the both of them were purely debasing for Ana, in my own opinion. Being manhandled by a guy is NOT sexy. It's not hot, it's not smoky, and it's definitely not steamy and sizzling. Not to me it's not. If you want to be roughed up a bit, Anastasia, go sign up for boxing, and stop being pitiful. In my mind's eye, I see this story going another way. \n",

      "When I got to that part in the beginning where Christian was telling Ana he is bad for her, these words immediately made me think of Twilight. A few days later I saw a video - an interview with E L James on ABC - and she said that Twilight had inspired her... \n",
      " In my opinion Fifty shades of Grey and Twilight are similar in many aspects: \n",
      " - Both Ana and Bella are clumsy and modest beings that are beautiful but don't have boyfriends \n",
      " - Christian and Edward are the type of \"bad boys\" that are too dangerous to be dated \n",
      " - Both Edward and Christian don't want to be touched - it remained a mystery for me why Christian was terrified by the thought of being touched but this will probably be sorted out in the next book, or the third ;) \n",
      " - and last but not least: Edward and Christian have something extraordinary (that's why they are main characters, probably) - Christian is not a vampire but has a very specific eye colour that is so attractive \n",
      " And now the main difference between the two books that I really like - Twilight is a young adult whereas Fifty shades is just an adult book. \n",
      " And finally, I get to discuss the book. \n",
      " It is just a brilliant book! In the beginning,after reading some summaries and saw that it was an erotic book, I was perplexed whether to start reading it at all. But as one man on the net said, \"It's about what you read, and if you are used to it\". \n",
      " Personally, this was the first adult book I have ever read. \"A first\", Mr. Grey would say. The first seven chapters were so good and romantic and I began to wonder why so many people did not like the book. Then, the more intimate scenes came and I was even considering leaving the book. Anyway, I contnued and will never be sorry for that... \n",
      " ...because E L James has made one great experiment by combinating the inevitable expression of love with the mental love. Even if you don't like \"those scenes\", just read the book for the feelings of Ana and witness how she changes Christian. \n",
      " The other thing I liked is the perfect life the author has described. In many books I have read, the characters are ordinary people with ordinary lives. But here, there is class and style on every single page. In the beginning it is awkward, especially when reading through Ana's point of view, to be asked out by a billionaire. But then it becomes something cute and you get used to it. Personally, after reading the book, I pay more attention to the very behaviour that makes Christian, and every other person, classy. \n",
      " And the last thing I will say, will be about the way it all was written. A lot of revews here stated that E L James did not write professionaly. I think that the way she finished each chapter and the book itself, speak volumes about her professional writing.\n",

      " Let's start with Anastasia/ Ana. \n",
      " This girl is the weakest main character I have read about. She has no backbone, no self-control, no brain. no anything. I did not at any point feel like this girl needed a control freak og arrogant bastard to be dominated. I am earnestly believing that all this girl is a baby, a freaking toddler, to be dominated cause she is that weak. Even though her dear friend, Kate or whatever, tries to make all us readers believe that Ana is strong, independent and never cries, that is not the vibe I get from this girl. At all. There is nothing to say that Grey wanted her since he saw an easy target... \n",
      " Grey though. He just pissed me off with his constant anger issues, control freak behavior and arrogance (event hough that was the point). I did not find him charming. At any point. He was just a constant pain in my behind, and I could not understand why she felt so attracted to him when he obviously is a huge douche! Enough said already. \n",
      " But let me just finish this little outbreak of rage off with saying that if there was anything I despised in this book, more than the weakness of my \"heroine\" ( do me a favor and notice the sarcasm, okay? it was the language. Never have I wanted to burn a book for the language more than I did with this one. \n",

      "2.5 stars: I can sum up this story in four words: \"Stop biting your lip!\" (Sorry--other readers of this book will get the reference...you will literally read that line more than fifty times throughout the book!). I will say this for the much-hyped Fifty Shades: while it was one of the most poorly-written books I've ever read, I did find myself unable to pull away from its pages. The basic story is the following: Anastasia Steele is about to graduate from college and is completely insecure (though strangely enough, totally alluring to every man she meets). When she stumbles into self-made 27-year-old billionaire Christian Grey one day, their sexual chemistry is instant. But will Ana allow herself to become a part of Christian's world and fully submit to him? \n",
      " I will liken reading Fifty Shades to watching terribly trashy television--you know it's so bad and doing absolutely nothing to enhance your intellect, but you just cannot look away! I wanted to read this for myself, since it's received so much media attention and people have vastly different takes on it. For those who haven't read it yet, this book is not for the faint of heart in terms of sexuality--there are many adult scenes, pretty pornographic in nature. Do not read this book if you are looking for a well-written story--very weak writing and absolutely awful character development. I gave it 2.5 stars because it did hold my attention despite its flaws, and I am entertaining the idea of reading the second book in the trilogy!

The best bit has to be the scene in the elevator at the beginning... And that's where it goes down hill. So much hype... Not much to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book is poorly written and incredibly awful! I've read some poorly written books that turn out to be halfway decent in terms of story and this is not one of those books. Ana had no redeeming qualities. Seriously? A college grad without an e-mail address? Giddy at the sight of a computer? Confused about why a man would ask to get coffee with her \"does he think I'm not awake?\"? He obviously thinks you're awake Ana, that's why he asked... \n",
      " Not to mention the actual sex was not really that \"hot\" to read and Ana's constant \"oh my\" made it less hot and more back room little house on the prairie. I get that she's supposed to be innocent and Grey is supposed to pretty much turn her out but she comes off more just plain stupid than innocent. I'm typically a finisher and I'm not even considering reading the next book in the series.\n",

      "Very steamy book series. I'm a bit tired of book series - it gets expensive to buy 3 books when one book would have sufficed. But I guess the author needed to make her mortgage.

O sea, una idiotez con bases tipicas de la ignorancia de la edad media con la esclavitud... Claramente, Grey tiene miles de problemas psicologicos, pero que eso justifique su manera de actuar (el cagar a palos a una pendeja joven e inocente -rayando la pelotudez su inocencia, claro-), me parece una falta de respeto total hacia el publico femenino. Sobre todo, teniendo en cuenta la forma en que la imbecil de Anastacia se deja manipular hasta el punto de excitarse con el hecho de que la caguen a palos. Un completo asco.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not sure if hate is a strong enough word to describe how I fell about this book. It is unacceptable in my opinion. Maybe it is because I believe all relationships should be have a foundation on the knowledge that both partners are equals. The idea of dominate and submissive abhorrers me. I also have a problem with men trying to control women in everything they do and when the author tries to rationalize it into something that is okay, I want to scream. Abuse and invasion of privacy is never okay. I continued reading this book in hope that Christian might in the end see Ana as his equal. This does not happen. I am a hopeless romantic and a sucker for happy endings so obviously this was not the book for me. \n",
      " Also this book was a little too cliche' in my opinion. The innocent girl falls madly in love with the rich beautiful man whom of course has a dark secret. There is absolutely nothing special about this girl and yet this gorgeous man has to have her. Also my favorite cliche' in this novel; the whole \"when we touched an electric shock ran through me!\" Really? Come on now, that is really over used.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of my friends who read 50 Shades of Grey loved it, but many of my writer friends thought it was terrible, so I had some serious reservations about this book. I didn't even pick it up until my sister lent me the trilogy and even then it took me several months to open it. With that said, I don't think the story was as amazing as I was led to believe. The story line was mediocre, but that's not to say it wasn't good because it was! And although it is an erotica, I've read steamier love scenes in normal romance novels. Also, the writing wasn't as horrible as I was led to believe either. Sure, there were cliches, redundancies, and repetition, but that doesn't make it bad in my eyes. I personally thought it was well written. \n",
      " Now that that's out of the way . . . onto the good stuff! I loved Ana and Christian's first meeting. I found myself smirking at nearly everything they said. There were moments in the beginning though when I wanted to smack Ana. Twenty-one-year-old virgins aren't nearly as clueless as EL James made Ana. But I did see a little of myself in her, which helped me to identify with her. Certainly not her situation though. haha And I do love Christian Grey as a character. He's mysterious, strange, and yes, sexy. \n",
      " Halfway through, I was actually anxious over Ana's decision. I even enjoyed all of their email exchanges, and the funny insights into Ana's subconscious and inner goddess, which I thought was pretty clever. \n",

      " devo essere onesta, ero molto scettica sulla lettura di questo libro, non e uno dei generi che sono nelle mie corde, ma si sa, quando si ama leggere la curiosita a volte e galeotta. Cosi mi sono avventurata in Cinquanta Sfumature di Grigio. Le prime 150 pagine sono state pesanti, senza niente di interessante a livello della storia, anzi, piuttosto banale: due persone molto diverse attratte una dall'altro, lei crede di non avere speranza e lui magicamente gliene da. Il tutto scritto in uno stile non proprio bellissimo, con quelle doppie virgolette che indicano i dialoghi di Anastasia e la vocina della sua dea interiore....insomma....pesantini direi. La lettura e migliorata dalla meta in poi, non tanto per le scene di sesso descritte fin troppo minuziosamente (tanto e vero che ho pensato che sia un libro non proprio adatto a tutti, nonostante si trovi in bella mostra ovunque...insomma, voglio dire, io non lo farei leggere a una tredicenne ecco...ma non e di cosi difficile reperibilita...), comunque non mi ritengo bigotta e non mi sono certo scandalizzata. Dico che e diventato piu interessante perche il ritmo e un po' piu incalzante e ti porta a leggere la pagina successiva per vedere cosa succede. E poi inizia a venire fuori l'analisi di Christian Grey: ho letto in molte recensioni che e un depravato, ma credo che la sua personalita vada molto oltre e pagina dopo pagina viene fuori, quasi con sofferenza.

      "I will say it is very twilight, it is not the best writing but what it lacks there it will surely deliver elsewhere. It's fantasy, a dream, a wish. Every person male or female wants someone to want them, this is feeding our need for that. We always look to our spouses and significant others for something we will never find in them. \n",

It was more about the story then the erotica content and I really enjoyed that aspect. I felt for Anastasia and her conflicted feelings about Christian and his unique tastes in sex. I loved how Anastasia effected Christian as much as Christian affected Anastasia.

There's a few BDSM scenes but the rest are actually just normal sex scenes. And what is with this girls ability to orgasm like six times a day. She's never had sex before, not even masturbated, and she can have earth shattering orgasms simply from somebody playing with her nipples! And don't even get me started on the period scene. Now, I have nothing against people having sex when they're on, but why doesn't she at least question it! She's known this man a matter of weeks and she thinks it's perfectly normal to let a guy whip out your tampon. She's self conscious about him looking at her naked body, but when it comes to that she's fine! She even gets in a bath with him mid-flow. No. Just no. I'm not buying it. \n",
      " And Christian? I literally cry myself to sleep every night in the knowledge that woman around the country actually love this man. Newsflash he's a HORRIBLE man. He may have money (and okay I wouldn't mind a new car, laptop, phone, expensive books, dresses, underwear....the list goes on), but he's literally a stalker, he gets angry 95% of the time, he can't commit to a relationship, he demands to control every aspect of her life, and some of those sex scenes were nearer rape than BDSM. If Ana was my friend i'd be sending her to rape counselling. That and she completely shrugs off her best friends attempted rape. She clearly says no and he keeps going for her. If Christian hadn't come in to 'save the day' she wouldn't have been a virgin anymore, but she just shrugs it off after a day of not talking to him and then carries on as normal. Clearly rape is a serious issue, but it's just being downplayed like it's perfectly acceptable for men to be doing these sort of things to poor innocent virgin girls. Erm, no E.L. James. I am not impressed. \n",

      "I read this book because it just seemed like one of those ones you had to check off on your list you know. I've never quite read anything like 50 shades of grey before I had heard of it I MEAN REALLY WE ALL HAVE HEARD OF IT.. but I never actually heard anything GOOD I feel like its different from most reads (or atleast ones I've read.. This was actually my first time away from my ya pararomance blahblah) with its descriptive sexiness and BURNING HOT sex scenes.. Lol I actually didn't think I would like this book at all I am super picky when it comes to my reads but HOT DAMN THIS BOOK IS AMAZING AMAZEBALLS OH FUKN 50 SHADES OF FUCKD UP BEAUTIFULNESS.. So I guess you could say I liked it.. I love the main character Anna, she's witty and has some spunk she doesn't put up Christians crap and then there's Christian oh lord.. Now he is one fine ass piece of meat. He's controlling.. He's hot.. He's damn perfect. But let me warn you there are a lot of reviews I read where women hate him cause he's controlling and blahblah but me I'm one of the women that find that FRICKEN SEXY in a man so damn I loved this man.. But if your all about women empowerment I don't think this is for you. Overall the first book is a light carefree kind of read AND ITS GOOD so if you haven't read it yet.. Please do, you'll fall in love!!! I'm currently finishing the second book 50 shades darker.. Ahhh\n",
      "\n",
      "Wow! This one has really divided people! I certainly didn't think it was great \"literature\" but it was a fun read... I know ladies (no gentlemen) who haven't read anything for years but can't get enough of these three books. I didn't like Christian at all to begin with. It wasn't the bondage stuff but it was his controlling, stalking and needy side. That actually creeped me out a lot! And I though Anastasia's attitudes and situation were a bit strange sometimes. However, I did want to know how it ended so I read all 3 of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd say it quite a hardcore romance. A new experience that keeps me surprise me, as I'm new in romance book. Heavy on action rather than flowery words, that's all I can say. But what I notice more is the sense that this first sequel of Fifty Shades is: it's too British, rather than American, since it's supposed to be the background of the story. It seems the nature of the writer seeps to her writing, thus it dominantly colors the story, than the original background.\n",

      "Fifty Shades of Grey by E. L. James is a unique and erotic romance that, to some people, may be viewed as \"abusive\" and \"vulgar\". However, there are millions of different opinions and feelings towards this book series and I respect ALL opinions, both good and bad. \n",
      " Unfortunately, while this erotic BDSM romance has captivated many readers, this story just wasn't for me. I came to start the series to see what all the fuss was about. There were many mixed feelings towards this book and I decided to try it out for myself. Alas, while I did make it to 62 percent, I couldn't read anymore. The storyline no longer appealed to me. I was very interested at first, but the hype diminished. I no longer have the urge to read anymore of it. \n",
      " I am not saying FSoG is a bad story. I'm just saying it no longer piqued my interest and desire to read it. While I have read a few BDSM stories, I would say E. L. James has portrayed the story wonderfully. I'm not against BDSM for I have read books containing it. Fifty Shades of Grey is a very unique book that is meant for certain people who ARE into BDSM and erotic stories. The book isn't meant for everyone. That isn't why it was written in the first place. \n",
      " Anastasia and Christian were wonderful characters. I love them as a man and woman who experience very erotic styles of sex/pain and the experiences of life and love. Even though I could not finish the book, I still love the characters. \n",
      " E. L. James is a wonderful writer and I only wish I could have had more interest to finish the book. Some books aren't for everyone. Each individual has their own opinion and I respect both good and bad, even the middle opinions, too. Maybe some time in the future, I'll pick up the book again and see if my interests and desires have changed. Who knows?\n",

      "I don't care what anyone says, I read for enjoyment not for the quality of writing. I LOVED this book! Great series so far...my full review on book 3\n",
      "\n",
      "I have to admit. I liked it. I wish I could have given it 3.5 stars. \n",
      " I didn't think I would like it - but I read it in two nights. I couldn't wait to get back to Mr. Grey. It isn't that you fall in love with him and it isn't even a sexual longing, it's just that you want to meet him, be in his presence, understand the allure fully. I suppose the first book leaves the reader wanting more of Mr. Grey and his idiosyncrasies. Or perhaps it is because I love psychology and weird people. :) \n",
      " For me, it is also very important that I can identify with the protagonist. I don't see much of myself in Ana (I'm more of a Katherine) so I feel a range of feelings for her, not with her. Her naivety doesn't bother me so much. It is written well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fifty Shades makes us realise that all women really want is for a man to make them feel like they are the only girl in the world.. and that she is his world.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am only giving this one 4 stars because I was not impressed by the characters. However, I LOVE this series. I fell in love with the characters (eventually) and I thought Christian and Ana's story was a beautiful love story.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not a well written book. It's corny and cheesy but if you're looking for this type of read, it is hot. After the first one, enough is enough, I need some literary stimulation ;)\n",
      "\n",
      "When I decided to buy and read Fifty Shades I didn't knen much about it. A good friend recommented it for me to read it, plus already many people spoke about it on media. I'm glad that a greek publisher already had it's rights and released it(even if I learn about it two years after it's debout) so I could read it easier in my language than english, which I was much more terrible than now. \n",
      " So, I must confess that I wasn't much of a reader back then, only few books now and then but after I read(and watch)Twilight saga, I start to look for a book to read, especially romantic and a good one. I was getting started to be a huge fan of romance literature but after Fifty crossed my way, well.. I change some of my notions about romance. \n",
      " EL James has written an amazing love story, different from every other I had read so far and still is now, after two years have passed. A love story that many people love it and many people hate it but everyone is different and see's things different. \n",
      " What my conclusion is? Beyond that everyone has to try hard and constantly, so they can exist near someone which they love(because we are talking about love not something else), they have to think first the feelings and needs of the other, not only themselves. Nothing is one-sided. And this is what love needs to exist. But everyone thinks and acts according to his needs and insecurities, and they aren't obliged to share them with the others. That's why many relationships crashes after long years of living together. \n",
      " However, the story don't talk about this only. The story of Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey is highly sensual from the beginning of the first chapter. An awkward interview, an intern offer and a last farewell before the elevator's doors closed between them, are few of the first sparkles that Fifty Shades gives you in this book. Anastasia's life is going to change dramatical after that meeting and as deeper as we go into the book we see her blossom into a woman who lives and learn new things, new emotions and new ways of dealing the complex personality that Christian Grey is. \n",
      " Christian wants her! Not as his girlfriend but as his submissive. And he wants her bad!!! He shows her his interesting in every possible way but he can't stops himself and cross some of his limits for her. What I loved about Christian, back then, is the first night they make love. He was a real gentleman! Anastasia wants him too, in a different way, more pure and real but she afraids of him also. The thought of pain is a hard limit for her. So we reach the moment in the Red Room. BDSM in all it's glory!!! \n",
      " The countless sex scenes in the book were realy shocking when I read the book for the first time, and they were immeasurably revealing. The way of pleasure some people wants for, compared with the most of us, can't be much of a shocking after all. Besides, is as the book reffered to as \"consensual sex between adults\". Right? \n",
      " Secrets, fears, overturns, insecurities are the key list in the flow of the story and you are going to have a shocking ending, that is going to take you at the first bookstore, to buy Darker, the second book of this amazing trilogy and start reading it on the spot. That's what I did...\n",
      "\n",
      "Well.. I read it. It's really NC-17, but I'm sorry Mr. Grey because I can't love you. You're too much like Draco with all the money, the attitude, the sex god, so every time I read it, it's like Dramione ff. And all I could think about is Draco, so NO. You're pretty damn hot, but I've fallen for Draco first. \n",
      " For the ending, yes, reading a sardonic zillionaire guy head over heals with a girl and got dumped also by that girl is good. I love the feels. XD\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering this started out as Twilight fanfiction, it doesn't surprise me how the main characters are presented. (Brown hair and insecure, copper hair and overly arrogant anyone?) But that's where the similarities deviate. The author says that she would not have categorized this book as erotica, but a romance. I would still categorize it as erotica with undertones of romance. The two characters are drawn, inexplicably, together and cannot understand why they are so spellbound. This is also reminiscent of Twilight, and a little cheesy to my way of thinking. But, I do have to admit to being enthralled and entertained, despite the heavy sexual content.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book is dangerous and despicable, the message it delivers is abusive. \n",
      " The relationship between the MC and this dude here, Mr-i'm-fucking-perfect-and-emotionally-damaged-Gray, is abusive. Romanticizing abusive relationships is utterly wrong. Please consider that i'm not referring to BDSM practices here, but to the relationship itself. WTF, there's even a f****ing contract here where Anastasia is given \"rules\" she has to follow in order to be considered worthy of Mr Grey's kind attention. What in the holy world. \n",
      " Don't even get me started on Anastasia herself. Holy and pure Anastasia who doesn't even aknowledge the \"weird\" feeling between her thighs. Like hell. You would think Mr Greys has redeeming qualities? Oh. He was abused as a child, hence he is the abuser now. That makes sense. Holy mother, nope, i'm sorry sir. Psychiatric ward to the left. \n",
      " What pisses me off is that the portrayal of women is always two sided: either they are saints or whores. And when it comes to that we often have characters like Anastasia. Oh yeah, women. They live at men's disposal. They have to nurture them, to \"understand\" them even if they are, like in this case, abusives, arrogants and overall ultimate pricks. Because you know what they tell you everyday, boys will be boys. \n",
      " Is not even stereotypically funny anymore. Rich dude and innocent naive girl. BORING AS HELL. \n",
      " We should be worried if a thing like this becomes a best seller. It speaks for itself loud and clear, a lot. \n",

      "Frustrated that her best friend/college roommate has come down with the flu on the day of an important interview, Anastasia Steele--Ana, to friends and family--agrees to help her out, although that entails driving some 165 miles in order to do so. But what are friends for, right? So she drives to downtown Seattle to keep the bedridden Kate's appointment with the CEO of Grey Enterprises Holdings , Inc., one Christian Grey, who is scheduled to be the commencement speaker at their graduation. What begins as simply an annoying favor for a sick friend becomes the catalyst to the biggest change imaginable in the innocent college student's life. \n",
      " Technically, Ana is only the conduit for the interview. The questions are written out, all she needs to do is ask them, and record all the answers. Good thing, because when she meets Christian, she is so flustered by his amazing good looks, and his youth that she is a bit tongue-tied (and mentally curses Kate for not having prepared her for him).Of course, part of the fault is Ana's for not having read the questions through, and blurting out, \"Are you gay?\", before she wishes a hole would open up and swallow her. She barely makes it through the interview, and his slightest touch produces reactions she's never experienced before. All in all, Ana is greatly unnerved by Christian Grey. \n",
      " Ana goes back to her life--her studies, her part-time job at the hardware store, her friends, including Jose, a photographer whom she suspects of liking her a bit too much in the wrong way--but she can't stop thinking about Christian. When he turns up unexpectedly where she works, she is flustered as she helps him gather the things that he requests--cable ties, masking tape, rope--although she can't begin to fathom why he should need these things, and he isn't exactly forthcoming with details. When Ana mentions in passing that Kate wishes they had better pictures of the young CEO to go along with the interview, Christian offers to do a photo shoot, to her amazement. An ecstatic Kate strong-arms a reluctant Jose into taking the pictures, and the next day all three show up at Christian's expensive hotel. After the photo shoot, he invites Anafor coffee, and she accepts--even though she doesn't even like it. \n",
      " Ana cannot stop thinking about him. Especially after he makes an overly generous gift to her of some very expensive first editions. She goes out with Kate and Jose to celebrate their graduation, and consuming too many drinks makes her bold; while waiting in line for the ladies room, she places a drunken call to Christian. She won't tell him where she is and hangs up on him, but the man has resources, and luckily so, saving her from an unfortunate situation, also introducing Kate to his brother Elliot. While they hit it off, Christian takes Ana with him to his hotel, where she passes out. \n",
      " It's obvious that this attraction between them is very mutual; although Christian continually tries to warn Ana away from him, telling her he's no good for her, she cannot resist him. When innocent Ana says to him, \"You're quite the disciplinarian,\" he responds with, \"Oh Anastasia, you have no idea.\" And when it reaches the point where it's obvious that something's got to give, then he reveals to her some of his nature, what he's looking for in a relationship, and he gives her a contract to sign, outlining everything in black and white. You see, Christian is a Dominant in search of a Submissive--this is the type of relationship he has with women, albeit one at a time, for he is monogamous. Although there is something he hasn't realized about Ana, which could be a deal breaker. \n",
      " Loving Christian Grey will not be easy, but Ana cannot help herself. When she's around him, she wants him so badly she can taste it. He does something to her, something very elemental, and being away from him is painful to her. But can she live with his very exacting rules? Does she even get a voice in this matter? And is there any wiggle room? Enquiring minds want to know. \n",
      " There is no denying that Fifty Shades of Grey has become a phenomenon in the short time since its release. I became aware of the hoopla and wondered about it, especially after hearing that the story was originally a fanfiction penned by author EL James, based in the Twilight fandom. So I decided to see what the fuss was all about, and I was more than half prepared to find it unmitigated tripe, and highly questionable erotica. I've never read anything in the bdsm genre before, so I was also apprehensive that I would not like this aspect of the book either. All in all, I prepared to dislike this book. \n",
      " But a strange thing happened. From the beginning, I found the author's voice engaging, easy to read, and well developed. It flows very smoothly, and her narrator, Ana Steele, is easy to like, and I enjoyed watching her story unfold. As for Christian, well, that man is just hotter than hot, and incredibly sexy. Yet no cookie-cutter romance hero is he; he is multi-layered and multi-faceted, and very riveting as we peel away the layers, trying to find out what makes Christian tick. \n",
      " While this book is definitely for mature audiences because of its dark themes and open sexuality, it is not what I consider to be erotica. To me, erotica is sex with a bit of plot thrown in, just a step above pure smut that makes no pretense at plot. In the world of fanfiction, this is often referred to as pwp--plot, what plot? But Fifty Shades is first and foremost a romance between Ana and Christian, a very sensual romance, and the sex enhances that romance but it isn't everything, it's a part of everything. \n",
      " As for the fanfiction aspect, if I hadn't been told that was the origin, I would never have guessed it. Even knowing it, I don't really see it (and I have read the Twilight books, so I am familiar with the characters). You might make a case for Christian being the controlling Edward Cullen, while I can see a little bit, perhaps, of Bella in Ana Steele, mostly in her clumsiness and naivete, but honestly, these characters are their own, and very well developed. She basically took Twilight and reshaped it into her own story, in the same way that Leonard Bernstein took Romeo & Juliet and made it into West Side Story. Fifty Shades of Grey is its own story. \n",
      " The question still remains as to why this book, the first in a trilogy, has gone so very viral, and for that I have no real answer. It's a good book, and I like it, but there are others out there, I know. This isn't the first bdsm romance, far from it. There are m/f and m/m books out there with the same theme. My only explanation is exposure. Those other books never gained the same sort of exposure. I can only speculate that some great promotional efforts took place before its release, and if so, more power to everyone involved. It worked. Perhaps it doesn't hurt that EL James is a former TV executive, and probably has friends in high places. I should be so lucky. \n",
      " While Fifty Shades is not erotica, in my opinion, it is erotic, sensual, and romantic. I understand there is a nickname for it--Mommy porn. Intrigued, I asked a friend what that was all about, and learned that it's because the largest part of the audience that makes up the readership are women over thirty. Okay, I guess I fill that bill and then some. I think that anyone who enjoys romance will love this book, whether you're into bdsm or not. I can't say I'd read another one, outside of the trilogy. That wasn't the part of the story I found the most satisfying. For me it was all about the romance, the love. \n",
      " I'm looking forward to reading the second book in the trilogy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I read this because I was intrigued with all the hype. \n",
      " It is not a piece of literature. It's fluff. It's the twinkie of books. \n",
      " What do I mean? I discovered this term from Cleolinda (http://cleolinda.livejournal.com/) when she was discussing her feelings on Twilight. \n",
      " A twinkie is just that. It's a sugary snack that's not very good for you, but sometimes you just gotta have it. \n",
      " That's this book. \n",
      " There's nothing really substantial and there were many times that I disconnected from the story because aspects of it were soooooooooooooooooooooo unrealistic that it bothered me. \n",
      " But I read all three books so obviously it didn't bother me enough to completely stop. \n",
      " But I did actually get bored with the sex scenes (I know, that's like the whole point of this book). I felt like James just copied and pasted the scenes because after a while they all read the same.\n",

      " Let me preface this review by stating that I went into it with low expectations. Perhaps that is why my frustrations exist so strongly, but it was nigh impossible to avoid the discussion and the excerpts that flooded the internet upon its release. I read them, I discussed them, and when I obtained a copy of Fifty Shades of Grey. I took a deep breath and dived in. \n",
      " The Good: \n",
      " As we all know, this novel originated as Twilight fanfiction. As its written, it can certainly stand alone. The concept is great and, barring what I will soon discuss, the character development has promise. I was appreciative that there weren't info dumps, and that information (mainly about Grey) was slowly revealed. Relationships and the world had depth. (I'm trying, guys.) \n",
      " The Bad: \n",
      " This novel originated as Twilight fanfiction. Throughout the 75% I progressed through, I briefly saw who were which characters (Jose = Jacob, Mia = Alice). The writing also reads like fanfiction gone published. This is glaringly evident within the first chapter of Fifty Shades of Grey. \n",
      " The character parallels brings me to Jose Rodriguez. I had an issue with how he was handled. Towards the middle of this novel, he and Ana are drunk. He starts pushing himself onto Ana, and then our dear savior Christian Grey swoops in to save the girl. Okay. Whatever. However, Jose is illustrated as Hispanic, and James even goes so far to point this out by his usage of token expressions such as \"Dios Mio!\". It bothered me how the only other minority in this book was the one who attempted to assault Ana. \n",
      " As fantastic as Christian Grey may be as a lover, Ana's constant vaginal orgasms (with only two mentions of her clitoris in what I read.) were wholly unrealistic. \n",
      " In reality, 25% of women have orgasms during intercourse. That isn't counting the disrepancy between vaginal and clitoral - that's overall. Not only is Ana a magical unicorn that possesses the physical ability to come from penetration alone, but so can her roommate, Kate! I know that women like this exist, but for the rest of us who physically cannot, its frustrating to read a novel that sold faster than Harry Potter further portray women in an unrealistic sexual light. Women need clitorial stimulation, and there are people out there who don't even know the clitoris exists. \n",
      " The sex scenes, after the first initial ones, began to drag. For the most part, they consisted of the same verbage, and towards the end of the book I started skimming them. \n",
      " Ana's constant physical reactions to everything Christian did - \"My breath hitched.\" \"I flushed and held my breath.\" \"I gasped.\" \"My breath stuttered.\" It is honestly a miracle to me how she was alive at the end of this book. Every time Christian had to remind her to breathe, I cringed. Which brings me to... \n",
      " The Ugly: \n",
      " Anastasia Steele. Innocent, virginal, shy, sarcastic Ana, flying too close to the Sun like Icarus. James portrayal of her naively and innocent nature is excellent. However, what puzzled me the entire time - Why Ana? Why is she an exception to Grey's every single rule? What about her categorizes her from previous subs he's been with? Was it the balance between her submissive and defiant traits? How she came out with a few witty one-liners? What was it? Ana was wholly flat and one-dimensional, possessing unicorn-like traits and zero flaws. (BTW skinniness is not a flaw.) \n",
      " The Annoying: \n",
      " If I hear \"THERE\" or \"foil packet\" or \"oh... jeez\" or \"groaned\" or \"Mr. Grey\" or \"Ms. Steele\" one more goddamn time I will hurl something. \n",
      " Would I recommend this book to someone else? No. Do I condemn those who do read it? No. One should never feel guilty about guilty pleasures, and that is what this trilogy encompasses. I feel that, with a bit more character building (especially with Ana) and a couple more rounds with editors, that this book (and the others following) would have been receieved far better. \n",
      " This is, however, not my type of guilty pleasure, and as such I won't be completing nor moving on to Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed. YMMV\n",
      "\n",
      "There are so many things wrong with this book that I will need to block out a couple of hours to properly write a review.\n",
      "\n",
      "Review to come\n",
      "\n",
      "This book is WORTH THE READ ! There's been so much hate about it over the years but I've been wanting to read it. I never really got around to it, I don't know why, maybe because I was nervous it wouldn't be as good as I've heard. Well it was, and I'm eagerly starting the second book! \n",
      " First off, this book(s) is long! I mean it's only a few weeks in length but you feel like you live a lifetime, and I was surprised it took me as long as it did. So, I loved that. I also loved that EL James has a natural talent for writing and storytelling, something that can't be taught. She weaves a wonderful story, and really the entire thing is about Christian and what makes him who he is. \n",
      " The only downside is that I still found typos and grammatical issues. The author's technical skill definitely needs a bit of work, but that's pretty normal and it didn't take away from my enjoyment of the book. \n",
      " It's really more like a mystery, I found myself skimming a lot of the sex scenes because it just wasn't really the point. The point was Christian, and figuring out who he was, why he is the way he is, and if he will ever change. Despite that not being the big pull for me though, the sex was hot! \n",
      " HOTTTTT \n",
      " Thanks to Christine Bowden for getting me these books, I'm loving it so far!!\n",

      "\n",
      "It was funny at first, but I was bored once I got used to its particular brand of bad writing. Ana sounded nothing like a 21-year-old. Everyone was constantly gasping. The sex scenes were way too repetitive. \n",
      " I had no idea what Christian liked so much about Ana, or even what Ana liked about Christian, aside from him being attractive and powerful. Youthful infatuation on one side and random obsession on the other - it didn't seem like a very deep or meaningful relationship. \n",
      " However, I never got the impression that the book was portraying this as a normal BSDM relationship, or as anything remotely healthy. I have no idea what happens in the next books (and don't intend to read them), so maybe that changes. I'm not familiar with Twilight so I don't have that context either. But it didn't really feel like it was glamorizing everything; it was a story about a crazy guy and a naive girl who thinks she can fix him, and she's wrong. It was a pretty ridiculous take on an abusive relationship, yeah, but I wasn't expecting it to be this bland and inoffensive. Disappointing.\n",

      "This was my least favorite book of the trilogy. By mid book, I was tempted to stop reading but thanks to an AWESOME friends encouragement, I kept reading. By the end, i could not download book 2 fast enough. More indepth review to follow!!! \n",
      " I only gave this a four b/c it seemed a little repetative but it is explained in book 2 and book 3! LOVE LOVE LOVE all the characters and want to beat the hell out of them all at the same time.\n",

      "A pretty decent, unusual read. The hero has the trappings of the usual romance alpha-male hero: money, muscles and perfect good looks. The heroine, Ana is a little watery as far as personality goes, like Bella Sparklepire Swann. And this isn't an ad hoc comparison. Fifty Shades started life as a Twilight fan-fic called Master of the Universe. But Ana has got a bit of nous, some self respect and at least pays lip service to a future that doesn't just involve OMG HAVING A BOYFRIEND. But what makes FSoG so fascinating is that Christian Grey is so completely screwed up. Not just because of the need for S&M sex and complete control over everything in the entire universe ever. That's more of a symptom of his inner screwiness. And it's the push and pull between the two characters and they way they're shaping each other that's so fascinating. Gripes: one can not TALK to a subconscious. It's by definition SUBconsciousness. And I could have done with the inner goddess stuff too. And who bites their lip so goddamn much? Also, I wish Random House had given the book a line edit when they took it on. Sloppy, lazy work. \n",
      " Still, moments of brilliance within a mostly good read.\n",
      "\n",
      "One star given for comedy value! Definitely not my cup of tea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet another insecure weak mediocre young woman lured by a dangerous control freak. Painful Twilight flashbacks, but this was even worse. Yes, it was worse than Twilight. The events were predictable, then main characters boring, and the repetitive use of the same words and expressions extremely annoying. This book is definitely not worth your time.\n",
      "\n",
      "50 shades of bad. The one thing the author did well was create suspense: I kept reading with the hope that it would get better. The plot line is something a teenager might write. The characters are painfully undeveloped, with the emotional depth of a kiddie pool. The sex scenes seem like they may have been written by a man or a woman who has never been sexually fulfilled. I won't even start to critique this with a feminist perspective. Well, OK, I will go there. The author infantilizes Ana throughout the entire book. How can a 21 year old woman in the modern day be so sexually and emotionally unaware? Adding insult to injury, Ana refers to her sexual organs, as \"down there.\" There are probably about 500 terms that mean \"vagina.\" Oh yeah and there is the word \"vagina\" which means \"vagina.\" This book, along with its sequels, has been flying off the shelves at the bookstore. I am really upset that this mindless swill is actually being encouraged! Ladies & gentlemen, we deserve good sex & well-developed narratives. This book provides us with neither. \n",
      " I give it two stars only because I used to read college admissions essays, most of which set the bar for my one star rating.\n",
      "\n",
      "Um. I don't know where to start, but I'll start with what everyone else has been saying... repetitive, and poorly written. \n",
      " And my own little tidbit: cliche and terribly written. \n",
      " I will certainly not be picking up the second book like everyone predicted I would...\n",
      "\n",
      "OK, OK, before all the E.L.James haters and low star reviewers (who have written some seriously hilarious reviews by the way, I laughed out loud reading them they were so good) jump down my throat for saying this, I'm just gonna say it - I like 50 Shades. OK? Happy now? \n",
      " E.L.James is not likely to win any prizes for her amazing writing skill, the ties between Twilight and 50 are just too strong and lets be honest, it gets repetitive, the inner-goddess deserves a smack and if I had to read \"oh my\" one more time I was preparing to launch the book at the wall, in fact I literally skipped over the \"oh my's\" so as not to become infuriated with Ana's super annoying over-innocence. However, and it is a BIG however, I liked the story. \n",
      " I have read a lot of chick-lit and I've become bored with the predictable plots and simple formulas. I will agree that there are a lot of negative reviews that I chuckle at and agree with, because you are all so right. But I STILL enjoyed reading 50 Shades, it is chick-lit that packs a punch and it opened so many doors for the erotic genre. (Even if you hate it, you can't lie, it did). I enjoy reading about the characters developing (shock, horror, yes I do actually think they develop), I like reading about Ana and Christian compromising and adapting and finding level ground, of course it helps the whole fantasy that he is rich, gorgeous and \"knows\" what he is doing in the bedroom... but aside from that I quite simply liked this book and would not be opposed to reading more of the same. \n",
      " I stayed up until a ridiculous hour reading the story and found that I could not put it down, and when I had to put it down (to work, live and eat) I was still thinking about the characters and couldn't wait to get back to it. In fact, I'm pretty sure I read all three within a week, as did my sister who swore she would never read such rubbish and has become as hooked as me. Don't get me wrong, I have friends that hate it - because they find the erotica uncomfortable, or because they take the view that they are somehow above the book, without ever having read it. \n",
      " Personally, I think the copycat series that have followed since (use a similar storyline to 50, which uses a similar storyline to Twilight...blah, blah, blah) are dull and boring, they clearly jumped on the bandwagon (you know who you are). And lets be honest here E.L has become the fastest selling author of all time and has made a small (OK huge) fortune from the books and movie deal. There's something to this folks, it's not just as bad as everyone makes out!\n",
      "\n",
      "PAIN AND LOVE, SO DIMINISHING. That's what it's called to be. Oh, for most of that love-is-helpless-from-lust moments, it seemed to relinquish the agony of dear Ana from her Grey. But I'd rather go for more. Yes. More. But I think I would have to take sometime to pause from this erotic series. I need to comprehend the details of those vanilla-filled-with-chocolate-fudge-with-a-cherry-on-top scenes that are particularly similar to what love and pain concludes in their fetish Steele-ing Grey and Grey-ing Steele inside the Red Room of Pain. \n",
      " THE ENCHANTMENT OF INNOCENCE AND PAST. It depicted the hoarse situations that it adheres disarming both of them as Dominant and Submissive. They are just an equilibrium of an unfortunate love-and-lust affair. It's kind of them to notice that in every way they seek the amount of endless pleasure they could get with each other. The other wins another; a gratified fact. \n",
      " WHAT IS IT ABOUT BOYS AND FIRE? CHEESE? ELEVATORS? GREY MEN? Well, they all deserved a perfect fitting for the best shortcomings award to guarantee Ana's need of Grey. It had a purpose and that's a big deliverance of circumstances to go along with the series. *Confidently abstaining myself with all of these explanations because it's all normal to understand when you are studying Psychology* My own perspective relocates the fact that there are instances to acknowledge between Grey being his own \"Fifty Shades\". Boys preferably may act like that based upon the nuances of what they always had in mind from those experiences they would like to put through. \n",
      " Well, I am distinguished and refurbished with all those tranquility of feelings. A brand new day to end for both Steele and Grey. Laters, baby. \n",

      "This review is NSFW!! \n",
      " This book truly surprised me by being worse than what I had imagined! Amazing. Every page is like an adventure into 'how you should not write a book'. \n",
      " I watched the movie first because I thought I'd never read this but still wanted to be able to know what the hell was this story that made a fanfic writer get so famous. Watching the Fifty Shades of Grey movie was one of the hardest thing I ever had to endure... I just couldn't understand why they would turn this into such a bad movie, why where the actors not even trying, why did everything felt so weird and fake?? But once you read the book you realize it's just a faithful adaptation of its source material. \n",
      " So after many people telling me it would be fun to see me reading this book since I'm always so interested in smut fanfics I had to try at some point, right? I just have something for bad books. I need to be sure that it's really bad. I need to read for myself and have my own opinions on it. \n",
      " What can I say that other thousands of people in this website and in the whole world have already say about FSOG? It's badly written, the characters are awful, the romance is the most stalker-ish scary shit ever. Which makes it impossible for me as a reader to get into the relationship between Grey and Ana or care about the sex parts enough. \n",
      " But to make this a bit more fun I managed to write a drinking game to help people who want to get till the end of 300 pages of boring stuff!! \n",

      " - Ana calls Grey a control freak. \n",
      " - Ana mentions Christian's \"Gray gaze\". \n",
      " - Ana uses one of these expressions: Wow. Oh my. Jeez. \n",
      " - Ana's \"Inner goddess\" annoys the shit out of you. \n",
      " - Ana feels something is \"Exquisite\". \n",
      " - Christian asks her \"What the hell are you doing to me?\" \n",
      " I'm a bit worried about including \"Jeez\" in this drinking game... Maybe you should only include that if you are strong with alcohol. \n",
      " If you don't want to read everything but still want to know some funny and amazing quotes from this book here are some of my favorites: \n",
      " - \"my heart is pounding a frantic tattoo, and for some reason I'm blushing furiously under his steady scrutiny.\" \n",
      " - \"Oh my... he really is, quite... wow. As I touch his hand, I'm aware of that delicious current running right through me, lighting me up, making me blush, and I'm sure my erratic breathing must be audible.\" \n",
      " - \"Do you always wear jeans?\" he asks out of the blue. \n",
      " \"Mostly.\" \n",
      " - \"They are damp. He must have used it already. Grabbing it quickly, I squirt toothpaste on it and brush my teeth in double quick time. I feel so naughty. It's such a thrill.\" \n",
      " - His brows knit together. \"How have you avoided sex? Tell me, please.\" \n",
      " - \"Aargh!\" I cry as I feel a weird pinching sensation deep inside me as he rips through my virginity. He stills, gazing down at me, his eyes bright with ecstatic triumph. \n",
      " - \"I want you to become well acquainted, on first name terms if you will, with my favorite and most cherished part of my body. I'm very attached to this.\" \n",
      " It's so big and growing. \n",
      " - I stare at him. This man - sexually abused as an adolescent - his tone is so threatening. \n",
      " - My inner goddess sits in the lotus position looking serene except for the sly, self-congratulatory smile on her face. \n",
      " - \"Ana,\" he smiles his dazzling toothy all-Hispanic-American smile, and I can't be angry with him anymore. \n",
      " - \"He kisses me passionately, forcing my lips apart with his tongue, taking no prisoners.\" \n",
      " - \"I enjoy punishing you. I've wanted to spank you since you asked me if I was gay.\" \n",
      " - \"Sunday,\" he says, and the word is pregnant with an unspoken promise. \n",
      " - \"Jeez, what a day. I am exhausted, physically and emotionally.\" \n",
      " - \"Elena! Holy Fuck. The evil one has a name and its all-foreign sounding. A vision of a glorious, pale-skinned vamp with raven hair and ruby-red lips comes to mind, and I know that she's beautiful. I must not dwell. I must not dwell.\" \n",
      " Welp, I think I'm done for now! My final conclusions are... This is not even a good fanfic or erotic book to distract. Just go find something better to spend your money and time.\n",

      " My first thought (over and over again)was, \"Good god, woman! A thesaurus! They're free if you look!\", which did bring me to my one light moment in reading this - Ana teases Christian about using a thesaurus. This means she know what one is, she simply didn't chose to avail herself of one. \n",

Though explicitly naughty throughout, you begin to believe in Christian and Anna so much that you want it to be more and more explicit and involved! I found myself thinking things I would never have thought would be going through my head! This is a book that you just have to read to experience yourself.

An atrocious piece of \"literature\" and a sorry excuse of a so called \"erotic novel\". How anybody could possibly find it any good is beyond me. It was poorly written ( I swear if I heard about her stupid Inner Goddess one more time I was going to throw my iPad at the wall), so incredibly repetitive and lacked a plot. I swear that Ana's reaction to everything was either to say 'holy fuck', 'holy shit' or occasionally 'holy cow'. Every sex scene they had was practically the exact same thing with the exact same words, only with a different location, and to be perfectly honest, it got boring very quickly. \n",
      " Christian and Ana's relationship was so incredibly unhealthy as he was too possessive, jealous, untrusting, abusive and subtly pressures Ana into doing things she isn't comfortable with or doesn't want to do, but which she does because she knows that he will leave her if she does not. It was not in any way 'hot' or a 'turn on' when he ordered her around, it was him suppressing her. The amount of attention this novel has received is obscene. The characters were a total cliche being completely unimaginative and a bore. This is several hours of my life I would dearly love to get back. \n",
      " My only comfort is that in the movie surely they will have to play down how much of an abusive and possessive dick Christian is because whilst millions seem to be oblivious to the fact of how blatantly wrong the way he behaves in the books, surely that the women who have been carrying on about how amazing Christian Grey is, can't be so blind as to not recognise the wrongness of his actions and behaviour on the big screen, right?\n",

      "Fifty Shades of Grey by E. L. James \n",
      " I have to split this review down the middle in order to be fair. First I will address the writing, and then the story itself. \n",
      " For the first two thirds of the book I felt the writing was juvenile. I made the comment that it felt like I was reading the work of a high school student who was needed someone to proofread an essay. One of the worst flaws was the main character constantly speaking in a kind of personal internal monologue in place of narration within the story, i.e. \"I did this, and then I did this, and then this happened..\" Another annoyance was the author's habit of using British slang and language usage rather than the American counterpart. I found that really stopped the flow, such as it was. I eventually had issue with Ana's repeated deference to her \"inner goddess\" and her subconcious. At first it was kind of cute but by the end I was gritting my teeth whenever she used this. \n",
      " The last third of the book was much improved as far as the writing itself goes. At almost exactly 66% of the way through ( thank you Kobo reader for turning books into percentage based acheivments! ) the author loses a lot of her most annoying tendancies. In fact I found it so much improved I began to wonder whom they had hired to finish it! \n",
      " Now the actual story and subject matter. \n",
      " In all, I thought that given the central idea was supposed to be a \"conventional\" Dominant/submissive sort of relationship it was actually carried off very poorly in this book. To me both of our main characters were bad examples of their respective types. In comparison I would suggest that fans and those interested in this type of fiction read works such as \"The Story Of O\" by Pauline Reage, and the various works authored by Anne Rice under her several pseudonyms. Even the grandfather of them all, \"120 Days Of Sodom\" by the Marquis De Sade, as grim and horrible as it is, is a better \"book\". \n",
      " To sum up, for a work that apparently began as fan fiction written around the Twilight series of books and movies which was changed into it's current form late in it's history, I suppose allowances have to be made. It's been very popular in the media and online so I suppose it must address an interest. It just leaves me wishing it had been done well. \n",
      " Afternote: It did leave me with a liking for the music of Thomas Tallis!\n",
      "\n",
      "** spoiler alert ** \n",
      " Before reading, I knew Fifty Shades had been written as a sort of response to Twilight (which I loathe) so I had built up a number of possibly unrealistic expectations regarding gender roles and characterisations. I also knew that it involved an aspect of BDSM and apparently was causing yummy mummies the world over to quake at the knees and rush off to shag their husbands for the first time since trying to conceive little Tristan/Arabella. Hell even Woman's Hour had reviewed it! What I did not know was that it was actually written as fan-fiction to Twilight, using the original characters and some of the original plot! \n",
      " But enough dithering, the book, the book! From the first it's clear that this is amateur writing. The characters speak in a bizarre and formal manner so thus any conversation between them is agony to behold. My personal favourite has to be the following: \n",
      " \"Paul, this is Christian Grey.\" \n",
      " \"What, THE Christian Grey? Of Grey Enterprises Holdings Limited?\" \n",
      " What was she thinking when she wrote that line? Can you imagine meeting Bill Gates and saying \"What, THE Bill Gates? Of Microsoft Corporation?\"? A half decent editor should have red-penned it to oblivion. There are hundreds of such examples and it's a sad reflection on an author that the most realistic interactions between her main characters is via email. \n",
      " It is possible to be a bad writer and still write a compelling book, for all I dislike The Da Vinci Code, I couldn't put the damn thing down. If you sacrifice craft you must lay the plot on heavily yet she falls into the 'Twilight Trap'(TM) of being crap and boring. It's possible to make a thin plot brilliant, On Chesil Beach is a perfect example, where a bonk gone awry becomes a masterpiece. The only difference is the quality of the writing, again it's clear Fifty Shades was written without any particular direction and with little self editing. \n",
      " I'm sick to death of books where the male lead character is a super controlling, super gorgeous super-squillionaire and the female lead is a poor, plain but good hearted sort who can heal his damaged soul and bring him peace. For goodness sake, do people think women are so destitute of affection that we'll swallow this bollocks? It's lazy writing, it's easy writing and we can't keep chalking it down to escapism when we live in a society where reality TV is becoming a genuine career choice for young women. Stop writing women as doormats and stop writing men as cavemen, it's embarrassing and cliched! It stretches suspension of disbelief to extremes to write about sexually experienced men and innocent virgin girls and then expect the reader to accept that she's able to have rip-roaring orgasms on her first go and that he'd be willing to give up his desires for domination because she's just so darn cute and clumsy! \n",
      " On the subject of the sex (or as Anastasia puts it with such elegance and poise, kinky-fuckery), it's really not well done and I can't say I felt any desire to hunt down my partner with the grey ties to hand. The fact that the main female lead is a virgin disconnects most readers from her experiences as it's frankly hard not to laugh when she's having multiple orgasms shortly after she's rid of her hymen. Christian is apparently utterly devoted to BDSM to the point that he has a 'Red Room of Pain' in which he can have his very wicked way with his submissives, yet for Anastasia he's willing to go 'vanilla' on the basis of... well nothing.

I gave it an ok rating because despite the name changes & the kinky sex scenes intensely peppered through out the book; it still felt like a fanfic of Twilight. It did not feel like the author tried at all to make this story and the characters her own. Having said that, there are 2 other things to mention: \n",

Everything she says contradicts everything she does. Not to mention the amount of emotional scarring she's bound to have. I did, however, rate this piece of crap with two stars. Why? Because despite the hate and revolt I felt, I still, for the most part, remained engaged with the story, even if it was in hope that the main character would gain a little self-respect. But kudos to society for picking another piece of crap that demeans women and the way they should be finding love.\n",

      "I have avoided this book like the plague ever since it topped the best selling lists. One...because I'm not big on erotic (I went through my Zane phase, and it got a bit old). Two...after reading so many reviews on how horrible the writing was I couldn't fathom spending my money on something that was not well written. So all that said, I actually enjoyed Fifty Shades of Grey for what it was. After doing a bit of research, I found that this book was originally fan fiction for the Twilight series. This intrigued me. This could also explain why the writing is not up to par. So that was forgiven. No, E.L. James is no Dickens, but that doesn't seem like that was her intention. She was just someone minding her own business, posting her fan fiction on a site where others would enjoy the material, and it snowballed. Just good fortune on her part, can't really fault her on that aspect. \n",
      " After finding out about it's \"link\" to the Twilight series, I, of course, found myself comparing the stories throughout the entire novel. And, yes, there are many comparisons to be made. The setting; the dangerous brooding leading man; the clumsy, unconfident female lead and the millionaire aspects. But that is where the similarities end. \n",
      " Fifty Shades of Grey is what it is. I read through it pretty quickly. It is in desperate need of an edit and someone needs a thesaurus, but knowing all this ahead of time, I was not as disappointed as I would have been knowing how well this book sold, I can imagine what some readers were expecting. \n",
      " I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys erotic and doesn't mind a few typos & overused phrases. All in all it was a decent story, with a different unique plot. (At least to me)\n",

      "\n",
      "Although I enjoyed this book I found that the storyline was very flat. \n",

I could be leading you to an orgasmic libido tickler or this could go the other way and appall some legit literary high and mighty, it isn't well written(a lot of repetition the same phrases over and over, similar to Twilight). Although it does elicit a delicious tingly shiver that held my interest. I am surprised this book has gotten the hype it has being that it is simply an erotic shallow classy-trashy romance. If you are looking for good literature with depth of character this isn't your book but if you need some mindless kinky romance for a change go ahead and read it. I do feel like I learned many new tantalizing things but really there is better stimulating fiction out there that teases the reader more. This is exciting for fans of sensual erogenous novels that this is getting so much publicity. I've given this four stars but it's more of a three and a half. It was something to quiver over and raise the eyebrows at. The ending is a cliff hanger that might make me pick up book two to see if the Earth shall really shatter for Anastasia and Christian Grey. I'll just have to see what my inner goddess decides...lol!\n",

      "I have heard a ridiculous amount of people talking about these books. It seems like everyone is reading them! People at work, on the bus, on the radio, friends are recommending them, it's all over my Facebook newsfeed, friends are texting me asking if I'd read them yet. So I decided to give them a try and see what the fuss is all about... \n",
      " Is it worth all of the hype? Probably not. \n",
      " Is it worth the read? I think so. \n",
      " I've never read any erotica before but the sexually explicit scenes don't bother me in the least. Actually, I kind of liked that, for once, I was reading about the actual sex instead of just the suggestion of sex or, worse yet, the explicit scenes that are just corny and gag me scenes in other books I've read. There is some truth in these scenes. No, it's not the norm and yes, it's a relatively taboo subject (BDSM) in most social circles, at least my circles. But it's real in the sense that Christian is honest about her preferences and straight-forward from the beginning. He doesn't force Ana to do anything she doesn't want to do. Everything is explained, in excruciating detail (the contracts were a bit much...) and she is given the choice to take it or leave it. And, as a side note, I really liked the characters, despite their many flaws, or perhaps because of them. \n",
      " I've heard that a lot of people are comparing these with the Twilight series and I don't get the comparison. The only thing similar to me is that they're easy reads that have kept me entertained. I've got a lot going on in my life right now so really, entertainment is enough. I don't have the time or attention span for much more than these days. \n",
      " I do wish more had happened during this first book but hey, it's a trilogy so I'm going to keep going with it and I've heard much more happens in the second so I'm ok with how the first one played out. Upon finishing the first book, I immediately started the second... always a good sign to me. \n",
      " So, if you're looking for a quick, easy and fun read, you should pick up Fifty Shades of Grey BUT the sex scenes aren't exaggerated. They're quiet descriptive and experimental, for lack of a better word. If you're not comfortable with or prefer not to read books like that, stay away from them. This isn't the type of book that you can just skim or skip over the sex scenes. Doing so would likely leave you with a third of the book, possibly less. \n",
      " I've debated between 3 and 4 stars for this one and had decided on 3 but have now changed it to 4. I wouldn't rate it as a 4 on the same scale as many of my other 4 star books but it's sort of in its own genre on my bookshelves so I'll rate it independently of my other reads.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm afraid I have to add my voice to the chorus that's REALLY uncomfortable with the dynamic in this series. In my opinion, in real life, nobody looking for a healthy relationship would put up with Christian Grey's harrassive, controlling, manipulating behavior. It's also been my experience that people don't change that much to be with other people. If so, it's rare and VERY elusive.\n",

      "Second edit after diving deeper in similar romances. \n",
      " When I read this book the first time, I was very new to BDSM themed contemporary romance, to be honest. The book got me interested, though, but after 'researching' more similar topics, I realize that for a book labeled 'kinky romance', the sexy scenes in 'Fifty Shades of Grey' is more vanilla. \n",
      " It was still a fun and quick read, the perfect light reading material, and a good choice if you are looking for a little more than ordinary contemporary romances or have never read BDSM related fictions before. The writing is easy to follow and not complicated and the plot and characters are rather straightforward. Don't pick this up if you are looking for high quality prose with a complex characters (a character with a dark past such as Christian doesn't make him a complex character, if you want complex see Jericho Barrons from the Fever Series by Moning). \n",

      "Okay. I will admit that that this book is over-hyped and not mind-blowingly awesome. The writing wasn't great, but since the book reads like YA, I was able to look past it for the most part (I did however, HATE how much the word murmur was used, jeez its called a thesaurus). That said I kinda liked the book for the most part. I was it the mood for romance and smut, the agonizing tug and pull of forbidden love and I got it. I didn't go into this book thinking it was going to be the best book ever, but I did keep an open mind and knew what I was getting into. Plus, I really want to see the movie with my friends in February because Sheriff Hottie (From Once Upon A Time) plays Christian. I'm curious enough to continue with the series.\n",

      " The book reads like an episode of Scooby do - superficial, predictable and forgettable. \n",

The whole story just seemed like a cliche of a woman's fantasy. To be the nerdy, beautiful but doesn't know it girl who attracts the gorgeous, wealthy business man who has a naughty dark side and teaches her all about sexuality. Some parts of it were very weird to say the least. It will be interesting to see how they make the movie since I felt like I may as well have been reading a porno\n",

Erotic romance isn't really my thing though and when I had finished this book I had no idea why it became so popular. I've read other romance books (that weren't so dirty) that were so much more enjoyable, who knows why this book became such a success?\n",
      "\n",
      "Where to begin? This will probably be the longest review I'll ever write. I should start by saying this book was given to me as a gift. I'd read all the hype and critique. Given what I knew, quite honestly, I wouldn't have paid for this. But, since I had the book, I decided to approach it with an open mind. I found this book is, in fact, a train wreck. My reasons: \n",
      " First, the British author, who obviously has no sense of American culture, chose to set this story in the U.S. The dialogue is ridiculous. No American college student speaks this way. Not only are many of the phrases and word choices strictly British, but the dialogue is far too formal for college kids. \n",
      " Certain words are repeated ad nauseum. The characters rarely 'say' anything. They 'murmur' to the point of making me want to toss the book through a window. They 'whisper', they 'mutter'. But they don't simply talk. \n",
      " Ana, the main character is beyond naive. She lives on her own and is graduating college, yet has never had a serious boyfriend. She knows absolutely nothing about sex. This, in itself, is difficult to believe. What pushed all this into the absurd was this naive young woman who has, by admission, never met a man she felt attracted to, immediately falls madly in love with the mysterious Christian. She hops right into his bed and his world of BDSM. \n",
      " I didn't find the sex particularly 'hot', as so many reviewers claim. Because Ana felt shame in her role, the sex, to me, came off as demeaning rather than stimulating. She was a possession, rather than an equal partner. \n",
      " Ana, to me, was not at all likable. Her character also made no sense. On the one hand, she is naive, meek, and suffers from low self esteem. On the other hand, she is independent and strong willed. I've never met a person who is all of those things at once. \n",
      " Absolutely everyone falls at Christian's feet. He has the world at his fingertips. Everyone does his bidding. His looks make women weak-kneed. He's dark and mysterious, wealthy, and only has eyes for Ana. Far too stereotypical of the 'bad boy' hero. \n",
      " That being said, of all the characters, Christian is the only one I found interesting. In the last third of the book, we begin to see how he became the man he is. I wish he'd been more developed, and less stereotypical. \n",
      " The only part of this book I enjoyed and cracked a smile at were the emails between Ana and Christian. In these, I found more honesty and personality. \n",
      " I have to ask, where was the editor? The writing here is at beginner level. A good editor could have, and should have, worked to develop this story. \n",
      " In the end, I am at a loss to explain the excited hype and rave reviews for this book. It's a case of damaged bad boy hero meets the younger, naive woman who, unwittingly, wraps him around her finger. There are far more polished books of this nature by talented authors who, for reasons unknown to me, don't get the kind of hype this book has received.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm done. \n",
      " I cant even finish it. \n",
      " I know I'm curious about this book because of the trailer. I mean the trailer isn't so bad, actually its pretty god. But the book, Jezz I can't even finish it, and I'm a person who have to finish a book. \n",
      " Sorry trying not to be rude, but this is so lame. Anastasia is a shame. I mean what about independent girl? what about girl power? What bout depends and love your self first the stop acting like a puppy. \n",
      " And Christian?! GOD I cant even describe it. It isn't love!\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I was so prepared to have problems with this book that my expectations were just right for actually reading it. It's not bad. It's not great. It's fun and ridiculous and has some hot passages. I'm more than halfway through the second book but I think I need to take a break from it. I've started skipping over massive sections of it just to get back to the plot points and that's not the strength of these books. I think the whole purpose is to follow along as Anastasia comes to terms with her sexuality and what she wants in a relationship. Christian is on one end of the spectrum and gives her plenty of material with which to experiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh my. Ladies keep a fan handy. The author gives a view of the S. and M. world that seems realistic yet tasteful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aside from the annoying female character with her internal \"oh my\"'s and the sketchy storyline, it's not a bad trashy read for guilty pleasure. I definitely think I overpaid however. lol\n",
      "\n",
      "Emotionally manipulative and abusive, EL James' series glorifies abusive relationships and dismisses them by attempting to pass it off as BDSM. On top of the dismissal of abusive relationships, the novel is badly written with very little character development and establishment probably due to its earlier existence as fan fiction, the characters and their relationships pre established in Stephenie Meyer's 'Twilight Saga'.\n",

      "That's EUR8.99 I will never see again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not sure why everyone hates this? It gets so much better as you read all the books. I loved reading about what happens between them. I know everyone says it's basically porn. But not all the parts are sex scenes, it actually talks about their relationship too. Just my opinion\n",
      "\n",
      "I read this book with some trepidation...but I'll be darned if I wasn't going to find out what all the fuss was about! I just couldn't stand to be left out! So warily I put my big toe in just to test the water, fully intending to jump out if it got to be too much. Haha...so much for caution. This book sucked me right in and I read both sequels. As if you didn't know, there is a lot of sex in these books, maybe even... dare I say it...too much. Sometimes, it just got boring. I wanted to get on with it (yeah, yeah he did this to her AGAIN and she did that to him AGAIN, yawn) now let's get back to the story already! I'm not sorry that curiosity got the best of me.\n",

      "\n",
      "I'm going to be honest: I never intended to read these books. I've heard a lot of mixed reviews. Plus, I'm not a huge fan of Twilight and at its core this is based on those books. But for better or worse these books have changed the world of books (especially romance) so I feel like I need to have read them. And I don't want to be the person who makes fun of them without having to read them. \n",
      " A few disclaimers/warnings: \n",
      " 1) This is going to be a long review. I have a crap-ton to say-both good and bad. \n",
      " 2) The whole review will have spoilers because honestly that's the only way I can review this book. \n",
      " 3) I think the sexual content is a huge part of why this book gained such notoriety. However, it's not unique. I'll get more into this later. \n",
      " 4) I struggled to rate this books and if you've seen my Beautiful Disaster review I'll say I had similar feelings about this as that. \n",
      " 5) Finally, I plan on doing a written review after I read each book. And then once I'm done I want to do a video review of the whole series. \n",
      " Where do I begin? \n",
      " Let's talk about Anastasia as a character and narrator. For a huge chunk of the book I was not a fan. To begin, I'm not the biggest fan of clumsy heroines. It always feels like an unnecessary characteristic. Plus, how did she trip all the time in flats, but seemed to wear heels with relative ease. Ana was also bland. She doesn't have much in the way of personality. And she would get a backbone sometimes, but it always disappeared quickly. She got better after she went to Georgia and I'm hoping she gets better. I have to say this: I did not like the first person POV. I think Christian would make a better narrator. Or maybe a 3rd person narrator like a traditional romance. \n",
      " This goes with the narrator issue in some ways: there were some definite issues with the writing style and dialogue. I couldn't help, but think the word choice was very British. Ms. James lives in Britain and I assume she is a native so I understand why it would happen. (That's what an editor is there for). And I can appreciate British dialect (Sophie Kinsella is my favorite author and I'm no stranger to Regency romance) but it should only be in a British set story and/or British characters. But none of these characters are British. \n",
      " A lot of the language, especially the dialogue, seemed stiff. I'm not sure this is true, but the word choice seemed very formal and I'm not sure contractions were used very often. It just felt like no one actually speaks like this (especially twenty somethings) and it prevented me from getting fully immersed in the story. \n",
      " It's time. Let's talk about the fact that this started as Twilight fan fiction. I think the first half of the book really showed this. You have this plain girl who somehow has guys falling all over her. I still don't understand this in any book. Jose is clearly the Jacob, but he really annoys me. He's like Caleb on this season of Big Brother. And Christian's sister reminds me of Alice. I really thought the Twilightness would bother me, but she eventually made the story her own. When things stopped being so tied to Twilight I enjoyed it more. And I hope she continues to build her own story as the series continues. \n",
      " Now, let's get to Christian. He's definitely the more interesting and compelling character. I want to know more about his past and why he is the way he is. And I appreciate his honesty. There are times he could be more sensitive like when he finds out Ana is a virgin. But he knows who he is and at least appears not to be ashamed. He also has this subtle humor I liked. It came out in his e-mails especially-like the subject lines and his e-mail signatures. I hope we get more of that part of him and I would love to get some of his perspective. (Crosses fingers). \n",
      " I feel like I've been very negative and that's not ending in this section. Ana is constantly talking about her \"inner goddess\" and her \"conscience\". I really didn't like either internal voice. I found them annoying and childish. Plus, she basically slut shamed herself. I can't stand slut shaming and it's made even worse when it's turned toward yourself. I completely get why she would question what she's doing, but I hated when she called herself a ho. And I just don't know why an author (especially a female one) would have a character do that. If you feel differently let me know. \n",
      " I'm starting to get exhausted, but I don't want to cut this short. So, time for the sexy bits. I've read a few BDSM stories (contemporary and historical), but this was a whole new world. I actually really liked the contract and how much Christian and Ana talked about the lifestyle. We live in a world where this type of choice or fetish mocked and hidden away so I don't know a lot. So these things were a great way to lay down some intense exposition. I would have liked some more off-page sex. Basically, I don't need full descriptions every time the characters get it on. And they get it on an awful lot. \n",
      " Sometimes it felt like Christian was manipulating Ana. She would tell him she wasn't comfortable with a certain act and then he'd be all \"but will you just try. For me?\" I don't know if I'm reading too much into his behavior, but that's how I see it. Admittedly, I feel like this partly because she's never been in a relationship before and doesn't completely know what to expect. As the book continues though he seems to be more accepting of her choices. \n",
      " Now, I want to discuss something I've seen floating around. And that's the idea that this book and its content is demeaning to women. I've already voiced my issues with Ana's character and won't revisit them. But I don't find the BDSM lifestyle demeaning to women. I figure if you are two consenting adults then good luck and God bless. And, overall, I didn't feel like Ana was coerced or forced into her situation. \n",
      " Yeah, I see the end of this review. And that's actually the last thing I want to discuss: the end. First, I thought Ana's decision was very quick and I wish there was more development there. But I'm so glad she left. I'm not an idiot: they will probably get a happily ever after. But she does need time away from him to think about herself and what she wants out of life and a relationship. Hopefully, they stay apart for a decent amount of time. (In all honesty, I give it three chapters). \n",
      " Those are my thoughts on Fifty Shades of Grey. Stay tuned for my reviews of the rest of the series, because I'll be reading them soon. \n",
      " And I feel like I used parenthesis a little too much in this review but I'm too lazy to try and change it, so I apologize. \n",

      " For the record, I don't blame EL James for writing this - I mean she wrote it and self published it at first for herself. Anyone can write a novel, no matter how plagiarized or horrible it is and no matter how talentless you are. No. I blame the females across the world who made this book what it is. Ladies, All of you - go to the mirror right now. Take a real good long look at yourself and then smack yourselves across the face as hard as you can. How on earth can you justify stating with a straight face \"50 Shades of Grey is amazing\" or \"Best Book Ever!\"? Have you possibly ever read another book? and when I ask this, I do not mean a book by Stephanie Meyer or Nicolas Sparks. I mean a REAL BOOK. Let's break this down in terms you can understand. Let's say you had a girlfriend who had remained a virgin and was in every way completely sheltered from the world. And suddenly this really rich and successful guy is suddenly interested in your friend and then you find out he wants her to sign a contract and to own her and then he ties her up and beats her during sex. But to make up for for all the rules he has in place, and controlling measures he's taken to make her a slave, he buys her clothes and a car. So,Ok. There we are. If you STILL think \"that's so hot\" - you are a rotten friend and person. Because in sane world, you should be helping your friend escape domestic violence, not encourage it. Why on earth did MILLIONS of women decide this maniac was the guy they wanted to fantasize about? This is the guy in mugshots on the ID channel ladies. He's not hot, he's violent and abusive. \n",

      "A hot and steamy introduction to the world of BDSM. As romance books go, this one was not bad. The usual tropes (an innocent, yet clever and smart girl falls for the dangerous, brooding rich guy) exist, but you could do a lot worse in terms of writing for a romance book. I wavered between finding Christian manipulative and scary and feeling bad for him. \n",

      " The one thing I did not like in this book at all was all the references to the Ana's \"inner goddess\" (no, not her vagina!) and conscience. It was like an extra character in the book. An extra annoying character. I kept imagining a doodle that pops up in her mind, kind of like in Lizzie McGuire. Yeah that's right. I compared a BDSM book with lots of steamy sex scenes to Lizzie McGuire. \n",

      "I couldn't bring myself to like this book. The author's repetitive use of certain words and phrases were very distracting and exasperating. Even the emails the characters wrote to each other were over done. I found them boring and quite frustrating. Gosh couldn't they just pick up the phone and talk to each other, instead. Once I hit the 70% mark I was totally bored. There were several moments where I just didn't want to continue reading the book. However, I hate not completing a read. I've only done it once and I was determined to finish this book even though I hated it. All I can say for myself is that this was not a fast read nor was it a page turner. \n",
      " I didn't like Ana at all. She is a smart young women who's self doubt and self confidence is that of a teenage girl. How can a man like Christian find that attractive? I was stumped. Her jealousy against Christian's past sub's (whom she never met) were totally crazy. Only adds to show how insecure she is. She's so afraid he will leave her that she is willing to do anything, even if she doesn't feel comfortable with it, just to keep him. Christian has issues. He is a control freak and Ana even acknowledges it quite often in the book. Some of the sex scenes were hot and some laughable. I know, I know...it's fiction. Still there are tons of fiction books out there that write way better BDMS scenes then this one. \n",
      " I could go on and on why I didn't like this book. However, I will just agree with the majority of people who have given it a 1 - 2 star rating. Most were right on the dime with their reviews.

      " First of all, let me say, I never would have picked this book up on my own. I was given this by a friend to borrow, and I decided to give it a shot, since there has been so much hype about it. I have nothing against romance or erotic fiction, but it generally isn't my cup of tea. That being said, I did not think this was a badly written or boring book. The pace was good, and there was a decent mix of hot and dirty sex scenes along with the regular parts of the story. I do have to say, while I appreciated the author attempting to explain the quirks of Christian Grey, it did detract me a bit from the story. *SPOILER ALERT* Especially when Ana tells him that he was molested...and he is shocked by that. Then I started thinking, if that was a 15 yr old girl, with an older man, there would be NO question at all. And that disturbed me, and made me feel very bad for him, even more so than I already did. The sex scenes weren't so hot anymore, especially when Ana referred to them as \"therapy\". It didn't weird me out, just made me feel so sad for him. I want to see what happens in the rest of the trilogy, so I will keep reading the books. It was an interesting reaction and definitely not a feel good romance.\n",

      "\n",
      "If you're looking for romance then this is not the book for you. This is a story about lust, not love. It's way overhyped and overrated. Honestly I hated both of the main characters by the time I was finished. This book was so obviously a twilight fan fiction it's insane. Also if you're from England writing a book about Americans try to actually learn how Americans talk. No one in America says \"do you need a lift\" instead of \"do you need a ride\" seriously. This is ridiculous.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wow, this is one STEAMY book! This book could make a call girl blush! There's TONS of sex....VERY STEAMY sex, but there's also a great story line. I started reading this one and couldn't put it down! I highly recommend this book, but only if you have a lot of time on your hands because you are NOT going to want to put it down!\n",
      "\n",
      "Dear lord, where to begin? This book has received so many mixed reviews, and so much attention. I really wanted to know what all the hype was about. It has a movie deal in the works, afterall. Totally would not want to be responsible for cleaning up the theater after the show. \n",
      " Okay, based on the quality of the writing alone, it reads the way an annoying college kid would talk, which I suppose is appropriate, given that it's an annoying college girl speaking. I can let that pass as getting in touch with the character. Grey's character...I get it. He's flawed. He's also not right for our sweet, innocent heroine. He's BDSM Edward Cullen (minus sparkly skin). The similarities were totally not lost on me, or I'd say, anyone who has read the Twilight books. The major difference is Grey pissed me off far more than Edward ever did. Maybe that's the author's goal, though. The way he talks is completely inconsistent. In fact, he's inconsistent in just about everything, and that bugs me to no end. He is so incredibly disrespectful to just about everyone. The only character I really liked in the whole book was the heroine's roommate. All in all, and my biases come into play here, I think Grey is Fifty Shades of Asshat, and the end had me cheering, with no urge to pick up the second book. In fact, the only reason I kept reading the book when the heroine refused to tell Grey off was because it has a car wreck quality, some kind of perverse shock value, that kept my eyes on the page, even while I was horrified at the stupidity and yelling at the characters out loud. Doubtful the second book is in my future. I guess you just have to be into that sort of thing to appreciate this book.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've finally got around to reviewing these books. I'm just going to come out and say it... I'm not a huge Christian Grey fan. I know I know i'm crazy. But am I? He just wasn't a strong 'hero\" in my opinion and he was very controlling. I'm okay with that to an extent but he just was ridiculous. Oh and his stalker tendencies were super creepy!\n",

      "Oh my! I finally read this book. Holy crap! I actually looked at an earlier pre-edited version, and this one is a big improvement. Bank that money, EL James! \n",
      " The \"romance\" part (i.e. the S&M part, which is the most interesting part of the book) took forever to get going. Lots of dull emails back and forth that can be skipped. And once she got to the S&M, I didn't find it erotic or shocking. Maybe I was too concerned that Grey would tie Anastasia up and put her in a shipping container. Seems like you wouldn't be extremely unwise to get into a relationship like that unless you trusted your partner; so mostly I was just worried, but not really, because I knew there were two sequels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ok, what I didn't like: her \"inner goddess\", using \"my sex\" as a noun for her lady bits, using there as a noun for her lady bits (this was fine in the beginning when she was a naive virgin but come on now), overuse of \"scalp prickles\" and \"beguiles\", excessive and unnessecary gasps. \n",
      " What I did like: Um, it's hot, sexy, erotic, dark, thrilling. Christian Grey's character is entirely enthralling and I want to know more. I actually get Ana's character and see how she could fall under his spell and actually give the Dom/Sub thing a chance and how utterly confused she was about her feelings. I appreciated the literary and musical contexts. \n",
      " Other thoughts: I'm surprised by the hype - I guess I never assumed that something that is borderline erotica would make it this big. I'm definitely curious about the author and her experience with S&M. I wonder how they would ever successfully pull this off into a movie that wasn't rated X.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ok...so I had to read this because I had been hearing so much about it. Let me start off by saying that I found the reviews for the book almost as entertaining as the book itself. I don't know who would ever pick up this book thinking they were going to open the pages of a profound and/or moving novel. It has been quite clear from its very first review that it is not a book that takes itself seriously. This is a book about sex. There is a lot of it. If you don't enjoy reading cheap and easy fiction with a predictable plot and flat, one-dimensional characters, then don't read this! This is \"light\" erotica. Don't kid yourself...if you're reading this book, you are reading it to enjoy some cheap and entertaining sex! If that's your thing, then enjoy, because there is a lot of it! (By the way, I read this in a matter of days, and had fun reading it! It's a quick and easy read that will allow you to escape from both the mundane and serious demands in life.)\n",
      "\n",
      "I hate that some sayings are repeated constantly throughout the entire series (with the exception of \"laters, baby\" [that was cute.]) I eventually got annoyed that every other page is sex. I hate that she is referring to something on her body as \"my sex.\" I wish there were more story line. I couldn't put the books down though. So touche. Hoping for more of the Grey's point of view in this story. :)\n",
      "\n",
      "This book is certainly getting enough media coverage, so when a friend offered me her copy to read, I decided I would read it, so I'd know first-hand what all the excitement over this trilogy is about. \n",

      " I found it too difficult to simply accept Christian Grey's accomplishments at such a young age - accomplished pianist, pilot, savvy businessman who thinks he can buy anything he wants - and does in this book.

      "Not only was this series horribly written, but it did not accurately portray the lifestyle it is supposedly about. It perpetuates a stereotype that people who enter into these consenting sexual relationships do so as coping mechanisms for abusive pasts. All the while depicting an extremely unhealthy relationship between two immature and codependent people with massive trust issues. It's not romantic and it's not sexy. \n",
      " I suppose you could skip everything between the sex scenes, but even then you have to face the poor writing and lifestyle inaccuracies. So, I suggest getting your smut fix elsewhere. And please, do not take anything discussed in this book about the BDSM lifestyle to be accurate. Being involved in a D/s relationship does not mean you can not love, respect, and trust your partner. Not every person who chooses to engage in BDSM has some kind of abusive past. I won't ramble on forever, but please don't make judgement calls based on a piece of fiction... Twilight fanfiction at that. Get your information from a more reliable source.\n",

      " Once upon a time, I had read the Twilight fan fiction for this. Pretty sure I got distracted and lost track after about twenty chapters, though. Getting to revisit it in print form, with a bit of polish and new names was weirdly interesting. As fan fiction is was amazingly addicting and awesome, as a novel it takes on a different look. \n",
      " What I frackin LOVED: The characters are what made this book, Christian and Anastasia were a blast to read. They were well developed and had great chemistry. I WISH Bella was more like Anastasia. She never let Christian get away with shite. She never let him take himself so seriously and brought out all of his vulnerabilities. I loved watching Ana make Christian squirm in his overly possessive flannel pants! (btw, flannel pants? Really?). The fact that Ana never let Christian really win, made me love her. \n",
      " I definitely liked Ana more of the two, but Christian held his own. He is the COMPLETE opposite of any guy EVER, that I would remotely crush on but I kept visualizing him as Ian Somerhalder and that helped, a lot. The dark side of Christian is certainly darker than what this book gets into and it adds to his multiple layers. I did enjoy his playful side, he could be fun and light, making him a fun read. \n",
      " The interesting bits: The steamy parts were certainly steamy, however there were sooooooo many of them (and, I'm sorry, did we need to mention the foil package every time?), that they lost their sparkle. The playroom scenes were much tamer than I thought I was gonna see but that could just be from the hype. That being said, BDSM isn't my usual cup-o-tea, so at times it was sheer curiosity that kept me going, not the steam. \n",
      " What drove me frackin bonkers: Holy repeat-o-ville batman! There are like half a dozen phrases that get repeated so many times I started anticipating them. The character reactions became incredibly predictable and by the end of the book I wanted to shoot her inner goddess. \n",
      " The romantic tropes used in here are totally textbook and lack anything fresh. Ultimately without the BDSM as added shock value (at least shocking to the vast majority of those who read this book), this would have gotten flat, fast. \n",
      " The Point: It's a freakishly addicting read, with elements that will completely suck you in spite of the meandering plot, lack of polish, and parallels to Twilight.\n",

      "\n",
      "Really I could have gone with a half star here. I really couldn't bring myself to finish this book. I had a 21 day rental on my iPad, but when the damn thing ran out, I was relieved. Time to move on! \n",
      " It was not sexy, engaging, erotic. I would say it was boring, repetitive and annoying. It was horrible and horribly written. Dull and unimaginative. \n",
      " It really was quite a lot like Twilight, minus the fantastical. I would NOT recommend it. \n",

      "Hace aproximadamente 2 anos, que una amiga me presto esta serie de libros. Yo tenia cierta reserva, porque ese\" tipo\" de libros no me van. Ni siquiera sabia la trama, solo lo que en algun programa de radio llegue a escuchar de el en tono \"novela erotica fuerte\". \n",
      " Aunque ya tenia en mi haber lecturas como el Marques de Sade, el Kamasutra, el Decameron, yo soy mas lectora de flores y corazones, de novelas que te erotizan con las palabras no dichas, con las miradas ocultas (Jane Austen, Anna Cassanova) o historias que aunque te arrancan la lagrima son de y para la vida (Alessio Puleo, Albert Espinoza, Javier Carretero, Jojo Moyes, Federico Moccia, Thomas Hardy) o detectivescas (Stig Larsson, Thomas Harris) o vario pintas (Sthepanie Meyer, Ann Rice, J.K.

      " Lo que lei en la Saga de Grey,es una historia de amor entre una chica \"virgen\" (es raro que las protagonistas de los libros no lo sean) y un joven (ninguno pasa de los 30's, y en este caso, como la mayoria, el protagonista tiene billete).

      " Es una historia en la que se presentan encuentros de caracter sexual con \"vistas\" dominantes-sumisas donde la mayor brusquedad sufrida y llorada fueron una buenas nalgadas. Tal cual. La referencia a este tipo de relacion se trata con propiedad, explicando terminos, alguno instrumentos incluso dentro de un contrato... pero de ahi a un manual para aplicar en casa, dista mucho (para los que eso esperan al leer). Esta bien contada (con su respectiva investigacion), los personajes bien marcados y debio ser un parte aguas porque esta historia esta escrita para que todo mundo la entienda y la digiera a la vista en referencia a un tema tabu que causa expectacion y por los resultados, morbo en la mayoria. He leido libros en diferentes contextos, asexuales, con historias fuertisimas, que a Grey, a esta historia, la dejan en tono rosa. Y para mi, Grey es una historia rosa, bonita: la inocencia del primer amor, la primera vez (o las primeras veces), el juntos por siempre, el felices para siempre. \n",

Simple libertad de eleccion y de expresion. \n",
      " ** Como etiquetan (o nos etiquetan) a las personas que tuvimos a mal o bien leer ese libro, cuando hay miles de historias aun mas fuertes (en todos los contextos) que cincuenta sombras. He leido y escuchado infinidad y barbaridad de expresiones del tipo: que es gente inculta la que ha leido este libro, personas que no tienen quehacer, que no tienen vida, que les falta una buena \"cogida\", no conocen del arte de la escritura mucho menos de la lectura.... dicho por supongo yo, \"gente culta, lo suficientemente arriba de mi nivel intelectual , que para mi propia iluminacion ha bajado de su pedestal, para iluminarme\" .... uffff !que coherentes! Hablando por mi, no soy una persona desquehacerada, ni ocupo favores sexuales, mi capacidad de raciocinio esta en el del promedio, soy empatica, soy objetiva, no me cierro al aprendizaje y ademas me encanta leer: total si no te gusta, cierras el libro hasta otra temporada porque eso si lo termino porque lo termino. \n",
      " ** Manifestaciones referentes a la violencia domestica e incluso a la misoginia. Definitivamente son planos diferentes, violencia domestica y relacion dominante-sumiso... en este ulitmo una de las premisas es salvaguardar el bienestar del otro, dando el poder y facultad de decir \"basta\" usando una palabra de seguridad...ademas de que debe ser consensuado......La violencia domestica se asume a cuestion de quien manda (sea el hombre o la mujer) dando por supuesto que es consensuado cuando no lo es, donde se busca el sometimiento psicologico y fisico.... En la misoginia se incluyen sexismo, denigracion de la mujer, Violencia contra la mujer y Cosificacion sexual (por cierto feminista)... categorias en la que NO aplica la historia, pues Anasstassia al ser consciente de ello dice NO. Como victimas o victimarios... va contra mi idea conceptual idealizada de la vida (Y SIN EMBARGO PASA Y EXISTE EN LA VIDA REAL) no encuentro justificacion para el dano causado entre seres vivos...pero definitivamente y en lo que todos los grupos de apoyo coinciden, si se tiene un problema lo tiene que aceptar primeramente, quien lo sufre.\n",

      " Fifty Shades of Grey was a huge disappointment. After reading some great reviews and getting recommendations from friends, I was expecting something good...or at least tolerable. It's not the erotic parts of the book that ruin it (although some parts left me a bit stunned) it's that the story is written in a repetitive and annoying manner. I wanted to kick Christian every time he reminded Anastasia to stop biting her lip which was every other page. As for Anastasia, could her inner dialogue say more \"Holy fuck/shit/hell\" after Christian said or did something? Could Christian run his hands through his hair more? Don't think so. On top of all this I found the story quite dull overall if you cut out all the sex. If you are looking for a summer romance novel, you can find better.\n",

      "Just realized I hadn't reviewed this. I posted about it while reading it on FB, but I think the immediate shame of trying to read it held me back from posting on here. \n",
      " I almost stopped reading the first time around page 10. Christian Grey said something about control that had the potential to be ridiculously sexy, and it was just disturbingly creepy. But I was going to give this book at least fifty pages, dammit. \n",
      " Here's the thing. I have read countless Twilight fics, and Anastasia Steele is by far, one of my least favorite Bellas. She drove me insane. I didn't like her as a character. She apparently went to a state university in a different state than the university is named for, and from what I can tell, she was raised in Britain. \n",
      " This last bit is what actually made me completely stall at around page 70. I have written British characters before, and I've done the reading and the research to know how people from various regions of Britain speak. E. L. James is from West London and you can certainly tell from Anastasia's speech patterns and use of certain contractions that she is, too. I couldn't stand reading the actual text, and I just gave up. \n",

      "** spoiler alert ** \n",
      " if you're offended by swearing and other such foul obscenities please don't read this review. or really, you shouldn't have read the book either, but whatever. \n",
      " but honestly... this was the biggest piece of shit to ever grace the bookstores. HOW DID THIS EVEN GET PUBLISHED? HOW??? Who thought it was a good idea to begin with? How did it get so popular and famous? Why are all these brainless women drooling over the thought of some cold hearted condescending douche bag flogging them silly and manipulating them into having sex for his pleasure. \n",
      " I have a number of issues with this book, but here's the low-down. \n",
      " Ana, graduating college student, interviews Christian Grey, CEO and 'master of the universe' (basically) for their university paper. She is immediately taken by his good looks and mysterious demeanour and eventually he proposes a contact to her whereby she will become his 'sub' and will basically control all these aspects of her life (so she must dress a certain way, eat a certain diet, have a personal trainer etc). I think the WORST was when he ordered a doctor to put her on birth control pills. That is not your fucking decision to make. I would have bitch slapped him and told him to shove those pills up his arse. \n",
      " I will say one thing, she was smart not signing that contract straight away and getting a taste of the goods, but honestly I have a hard time believing that a goody two shoes virgin like herself would 'fuck' this guy so soon after meeting him and it to be magical and wonderful etc etc. Ana, who hasn't been drunk before, gets drunk and loses her virginity and pretty much feels no shame, in the space of what, 50 pages? \n",
      " And from there it spirals out of control. This book is so overdone. Jesus, she got turned on by using his toothbrush, by looking at his toes, by the way he wore his stupid jeans. And not just once, but over and over again. Not to mention that Christian is fabulously rich and has everything and while she's just trying to be polite like 'oh I don't need you to buy me clothes', who are you kidding, she was loving it. The new car, laptop, clothes, phone and given her own bedroom in his apartment. He upgraded her to first class flights, took her in his helicopter from one city to another, and there is no lie that she lapped up every moment of it. It's a wonder he didn't own his own island and palace. But honestly, what did he actually do? Some CEO he is, able to drop everything to stalk Ana at a hotel, clear his meetings to have his way with her. It was basically a 'too good to be true' scenario I didn't care for. He was a big fucking show off and wasn't subtle about it either. \n",
      " I also want to point out that I don't exactly like erotic fiction so my review may be heavily biased (honestly, it's all so over done, insincere and stupid, and with all of these types of books, it is always, literally, ANY excuse to have sex. ANY EXCUSE). But the sex wasn't that good. It was immature with her constant phrases like 'holy shit' 'holy crap' 'jeez' and references to 'my sex' meaning, obviously, her vagina. And all that crap about an 'inner goddess' and her 'subconscious' didn't do anything for me either. I don't know what an inner goddess is meant to feel like but it sounds retarded, especially when she often makes reference to it. I think it's just a nicer way of Ana saying 'fuck, I'm horny' but no she's just like 'my inner goddess is purring'. And Christian isn't much better. 'Oh Ana you're so wet, yes you like this don't you, oh my god Miss Steele you are incredible and so wet for me oh baby'. I'd just like to put it out there that if I was, say, in the moment with this man, I would be the one gagging him just so he would STFU. Does anyone actually talk like this in real life? \n",
      " But the one thing that annoyed me THE MOST in the whole book was when they decided to have sex when she was on her period. AND HE PULLED OUT HER TAMPON FOR HER. AND SHE FOUND THAT ORGASMIC. AND THEY FUCKED AND THERE WAS BLOOD. ----VOMIT!---- AND SHE DIDN\"T BOTHER TO CLEAN HERSELF. THEY FUCKED, AGAIN. AND THEN HAD A BATH. and i'm sitting there like 'this is like a scene from Carrie in my head'. when I'm on my period, all I want to do is curl up and die and occasionally emerge to heat up my heat pack and cry. I don't want some pompous douche bag leaning me over a sink and ripping the one thing holding me together clean from my body. did he put it in the toilet? did he look at it? okay I don't want to know, to be honest. \n",
      " Honestly it reads like a middle aged woman watched a couple of bad 80s pornos and decided to write fan fiction one night when she was drunk. I wouldn't mind so much if this book was put away somewhere as being an 'erotic novel' but the fact that it is on the best seller stand, in plain view, next to the kids section at Target, really pisses me off. I like watching people buying it for their mums and grandmas, thinking its this wonderful sophisticated novel about a businessman and all this crime-solving shit is about to go down. (yes I thought it was a crime/thriller series like The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, which coincidentally I thought was a porno). \n",
      " ENOUGH THOUGH I'm tired of thinking about this book but it really is fun to hate. No really. I want to read the others because it is HILARIOUS and stupid and I don't know why I like that better than a solid, well written book. Must be my inner goddess =P. BAHAHAHA.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wow!!! I found my heart racing with Ana's and felt her frustration at trying to understand and wanting more from Christian. I need to go out and get the second book ASAP, but I want the 3rd one to be out soon because I know I will want it as soon i finish Fifty Shades Darker. Wow\n",
      "\n",
      "A cliffhanger? Seriously? \n",
      " Man... the sex was getting REALLY boring there at the end, although in the middle it was super hot. Is it worth it to read the next one or not? Is his past really that horrifying or exciting? \n",
      " Overall, this book was not nearly as bad as I thought it was going to be. I actually liked it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Series was ok, not great...they were both such insecure people and that really drove me crazy throughout all 3 books. I felt 2nd book was best.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some issues with the protagonist and the relationship that made me cringe but hey, it was a good story.\n",
      "\n",
      "OK, so I started out with three stars because I was feeling a little more forgiving than I do today after I have read about the first 50 or so pages of the second book. And now my tolerance level for this book has hit rock bottom. \n",
      " It was an easy read and easy to get swept up into some of the story but in hindsight the book was horrendous. And I liked Twilight. That this began as Twilight fanfic is actually kind of frightening. \n",
      " I think if I ever read the following words/phrases again, I will begin screaming and never stop: \n",
      " 1)Oh my \n",
      " 2)Holy shit/crap/cow/fuck \n",
      " 3)Bewitching \n",
      " 4)Beguiling \n",
      " 5)Jeez \n",
      " Note to aspiring writers: Do NOT use the same words and phrases over and over and over again. \n",
      " Then after all of this repetetive nonsense, she throws in large words not commonly used in speech to make us think she is clever. Which makes the prose even more frustrating because it is inconsistent with the rest of her vocabulary. \n",
      " And the story? BDSM play is fine. And what happens in the \"playroom\" is fine. But the level of control and stalker tendencies displayed outside the bedroom is horrific. This relationship is abusive. Period. Ana is terrified to communicate what she wants because she doesn't want to lose him. She is incredibly co-dependant for someone who has only known her boyfriend for a couple of weeks. No matter how much goes wrong, she always ends up throwing herself back at him. Neither of these characters is redeeming. \n",
      " By the time I got to the second book and it was the same old bullshit and same old unrealistic depiction of a female's ability to orgasm on command. I almost felt like this was written by a man. The same writing style with the same repetetive phrases made me finally put down the book in exasperation. \n",
      " I'm not sure I will ever pick it back up again.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know how to rate this... Yes, the writing was not good, but I am annoyingly immersed in the story itself. Curse you, E.L. James! I feel guilty reading this...\n",

      "'Books' like Twilight and Fifty Shades of Grey scare the living daylights out of me (as a writer and as a person). \n",
      " Basically, this 'book' has all the problems that Twilight has (after all, FSoG was originally written as Twilight fan fiction). \n",
      " No, FSoG doesn't have sparkly vampires and there's the \"BDSM-lens\" element to give the story a bit of edge. Yes, some people will find \"Christian's stalker tendencies\" (self-described by the female protagonist, BellAna--oops, I mean, Ana--on page 418) to be the definition of \"hot,\" and will be awed by E L James' portrayal of Christian's \"emotional intensity.\" Reading is a personal affair and what constitutes \"good writing\" can be a very subjective thing. \n",
      " That being said... \n",
      " If you enjoyed the erotic elements of FSoG, I would like to recommend and encourage you to try the REAL erotic classic works that have stood the test of time (Anais Nin, Henry Miller, D.H. Lawrence, Marquis de Sade, Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, to name a few). Classic works are classic works for a reason: they have substance and quality, something which seems to be lacking in our era which celebrates hype/image/packaging > true substance. \n",
      " Compared to Twilight, FSoG is hardcore. Compared to Anais Nin, well... \n",
      " The thing about commercial romances that is worrisome and disturbing is how they mostly always feature a female protagonist who either has no sense of self or low self-esteem, or who chooses to define her entire self-worth based on \"her man\" or her relationships. \n",
      " It is troubling that so many women from all walks of life identify with this theme, that was first exploited (oops, I mean, \"presented as wholesome YA literature\") on a massive, maniacal-religious scale with Twilight. Look up the definition of cult -- doesn't that describe the legions of Twihards? \n",
      " I've gotten a headache from the amount of times \"Holy shit!\" has appeared in the text of FSoG, but that's another story for another day... \n",
      " I'm still reading FSoG and combing through the text, though these two passages caught my eye the other day. \n",
      " Passage #1 features Ana, the female protagonist, talking with her mom over the phone: \n",
      " Passage #1 (Page 279): \n",
      " \"Ana, please, you're worrying me.\" \n",
      " I take a big breath. \"I've kind of fallen for this guy, and he's so different from me, and I don't know if we should be together.\" \n",
      " \"Just take it easy with him and keep him at arm's length until you decide whether he's worthy of you.\" \n",
      " Wow...it's unnerving when my mother is so insightful, but she's just too late on this. Is he worthy of me? That's an interesting concept. I always wonder whether I am worthy of him. \n",
      " Passage #2 (Page 418): \n",
      " [Christian] turns to greet my mom. \"Mrs. Adams, I am delighted to meet you.\" \n",
      " How does he know her name? He gives her the heart-stopping, Christian Grey-patented, full-blown, no-prisoners smile. She doesn't have a hope. My mother's lower jaw practically hits the table. Jeez, get a grip, Mom. She takes his proffered hand, and they shake. My mother hasn't replied. Oh, complete dumbfounded speechlessness is genetic--I had no idea. \n",
      " Holy shit. Can we say, 'like mother, like daughter'? That in and of itself in this context, is far more horrifying than the \"spluttering guts and gore\" that features in the average horror novel. \n",
      " Yes, I can see the \"addictive\" (for f*ck's sake, it's 'addictive', not 'addicting'!!) quality in the prose style of TL and FsoG. \n",
      " But I will choose to stay on my diet of quality books. After all, we are what we consume, and according to this article in The Guardian UK, we become like the characters in the novels we read (thanks to Joseph Grinton for the link). \n",
      " I will end this review with an excerpt from the introduction to one of my promotional eBooks for PLAY (a BDSM anthology I completed in late 2011): \n",
      " . . .I've noticed that Fifty Shades of Grey seems to follow the same pattern of Twilight (virgin female protagonist with \"sexual desires,\" who defines her entire sense of self-worth, self-identity and self-esteem according to \"her man\" who comes in the form of the \"rich, handsome\" piece that's part of the whole fairy tale syndrome). \n",
      " That's fine for \"commercial fluff.\" \n",
      " But in the case of Twilight, it gets dangerous when mainstream tween fiction teaches girls to define themselves solely by their relationships. \n",
      " What's Fifty Shades of Grey teaching women? That the holy trinity of obsession, low self-esteem, and abusive behavior packaged as \"mommy porn\" is the new love story? \n",
      " As a person who's had a long-time interest in the psychosexual themes of both BDSM and the erotic life in general, I thought I'd share with others some of the deeper perspectives that aren't covered by a mainstream mass media that's only interested in reaping in profits via the next cash cow franchise. \n",
      " No matter how much I might loathe many commercial franchises, I do care about the people that these franchises exploit (or \"seek to appease,\" to put it more politely). \n",
      " \"Mommy porn\" is just like any other type of porn--it's an adult fantasy that's designed to titillate and/or arouse the reader/customer (and generate profits for the supplier). \n",
      " Is porn really how we should define our sex lives? \n",

      "\n",
      "I listened to this book. I enjoyed it a lot more by listening to it then I think I would have if I tried to actually read it. I think I would have got very annoyed by the characters because of their issues and thrown the book across the room. On audio you can't do that so I pushed through the parts that annoyed me. I don't like men who feel the need to control women. I don't like women who are submissive. Also, the need to spank or punish an adult is totally out of the question for me. \n",
      " I don't find it as amazing as many of my friends have but then again I have passed the point where these types of book capture my interest. With that being said I have to say overall I thought the book was ok but not the most amazing thing I have ever read by along shot. I can see why it has major appeal to women and men alike. This book explores many sexual issues that people have. Sex is very taboo for many people so this book could possible be an outlet or at least a conversation starter for many people on the subject. I did like the fact that this book got people talking about sex, about the issue of child abuse, about what is a healthy relationship but most of all it got people reading. So, no matter if you love this book, just think its alright or hate it you will have to agree that it has done a lot to spark the reading community. It has even made reads out of non reads and to me that is always a good thing.\n",

      "I picked this one up because it scored second place in Goodreads 2011 Romance picks. After reading it, I can definitely see why so many people give it a high score. However, I am slightly surprised that it took second place as dom/sub isn't everyone's cup-of-tea. \n",
      " Things I really liked about this book: \n",
      " - I loved the meloncholy edge to the story. \n",
      " - I loved how the heroine was so undecided on her feelings of giving up control. On one hand it made her crazy-excited, on the other it scared the %#$* out of her. I think I identify with her on a personal level. \n",
      " - I loved the complexity of the characters in this one. On a side note, sometimes I think to be a good author you must be very observant of people in real life, to be able to capture mannerisms and subtle bits through prose. \n",
      " - I loved that the author wasn't afraid to flex her vocabulary and use words like mercurial - sardonic - taciturn - sagacity - avuncular - etc (things you don't typically see in run-of-the-mill erotica).\n",
      "\n",
      "An excerpt from the Lone Book Club blog: \n",
      " With the writing being so bad, how could these books be so popular?? How is it a mulit-million dollar franchise that women of all ages swoon over?? I'll tell you why: It is 100% every woman's fantasy. Don't argue, it is. Christian Grey appeals to every primal desire and urge women have. \n",
      " 1. He's stunning. He is so good looking that I cannot create a mental image when he is described. He has every physical attribute that females are programed to want. \n",

However, I still - even knowing the circumstances - found the main character to be so weak that it drove me nuts. She would have a moment of backbone but then spend the next few pages worrying / lamenting that lover boy was going to be mad, or didn't really like her etc. I found myself groaning at times and reading extra not because I was excited to but because it would take me closer to the end (I hate not finishing books).

      "The writing leaves a lot to be desired and there are spelling mistakes, at least in the version I read (what exactly are \"sandles\"?). The author has been heavily influenced by the Twilight series of teen books and by the film Pretty Woman, set out to write a porn version for adult women and is now laughing all the way to the bank. There is not much of a plot; this is a book of sex scenes interspersed with trips on Christian Grey's helicopter. The main character Anastasia behaves more like an immature hysterical teenager than a woman in her early twenties. Some of the intimate scenes between Christian Grey (impossibly handsome, wealthy, moody, troubled control freak, you get the idea) and Anastasia (not to mention her tiresome inner goddess who got a look in at every opportunity) are vicious sado-masochism, giving him a chance to exercise his love of domination over his sexual partners. \n",

      "I think the characters were really underdeveloped in this book. While all of the narrative writing was colorful and engaging, the dialogue, however, was lacking and very dry for me. I found myself skipping over it just to get to the good scenes. I was intrigued by the book no less, but still I do not think that it lives up to the rave reviews it is getting. And anastasia steele is an annoying character. Do females really obsess like that and have that deep of jealousy issues? If so we need some serious counseling as a gender.... Her dialogue sections alone and her mind rants made me roll my eyes everytime (no pun intended). I also found some of there fore play discussions to be very corny. I'm not trying to ask for poetry and eloquent speeches before they have sex each time, but for God sakes don't make absurdly unnecessary comments while it's happening. It's annoying and kills the moment for me. I have heard rumor that the next book is more character development and less sex and while I am intrigued to discover more of the mystery that is Christian Grey, I am unsure if I want to deal with another 500 pages of whining and repetitive probing questions by the uninteresting Anastasia Steele. Plus if there's hardly any BDSM scenes with Christian to look forward to, what's the point really.... Overall though I'd say it was an ok read, but the dialogue was elementary, repetitive, and vastly lacking.\n",

      " Why I hated the book: \n",
      " 1- It's like Twilight (EXACTLY TWILIGHT) except not for young adults. At least Twilight had the excuse that it was written for a younger audience, so I gave it a pass and didn't hate it as much. But this... I'm never getting back the time I spent reading that. \n",
      " 2- The sex that everyone is talking about? Has the author ever read an erotic novel? Cuz that sure wasn't stimulating at all... why are people getting worked up over this????? \n",
      " 3- The characters... I can't stand this Anastasia person - doesn't she have a mind of her own or does \"extreme hotness\" and \"overwhelming wealth\" takes away all sense of self and identity in a woman. Let's be real, if Christian Grey wasn't rich or \"OMG he's so hot\", what exactly would entice a woman to be with him? He'd just be a tormented, overly controlling, possessive abuser - and what exactly is so hot about that? \n",
      " I have a problem with weak female characters in book... maybe it's my issue then. Why the constant self-denigration in comparison to Grey who she's not hot enough to be with. Seriously??? Get some self-esteem. \n",
      " 4- It promises BDSM which never ever EVER happens - it's just poorly written porn!! \n",
      " Why I think people love this book: \n",
      " The plain Jane getting the hot guy. The unnoticeable chick getting the popular Jock or the hottest guy in school/work/wherever. Giving hope to them all that that could happen for them too... Look it's fantasy, and let's be for real, it's total crap - But E.L. James is taking her crap all the way to the bank. And that's just sad for the world of literature.\n",

      " I think I had to leave it at one point because I didn't know what the hell I was reading or what kind of genre it was, but I ended up going back to it and managed to finish it, and there was only one word that came to mind. Fuck... \n",
      " I remember everyone talking about it and the book being advertised everywhere, and I bought it from the Kindle Store. I wanted to be involved in all the hype because literally everyone was talking about it. Little did I know what I was getting into. \n",
      " I read Fifty Shades again when I was a bit older and started to understand the story a bit more. \n",
      " I think the story as a whole was interesting...but what let this series down, was the film. Now I'm a huge lover of films, but for me the film was a huge disappointment. I wanted to like the film so bad, and I hate to be negative because this is someone's work, but I was cringing throughout the whole film. Some parts were good but other parts had me like 'What the fuck?' \n",
      " The book though...I liked. I pictured Christian to look somewhat like Matt Bomer or Ian Somerhalder. Jamie Dornan is gorgeous there's no doubt about that, but he wasn't what I pictured to being my Christian Grey. Sorry :/ \n",
      " Going back to the story, I actually really liked it because it's not the kind of story I've ever read before, but again other people might disagree with me, but that's okay because we all like different things. The only thing I hated about this book was Anastasia. I just didn't connect to her as a character at all, and I have a thing about reading books with the heroine being a push over. I hate it. \n",
      " I also felt there were too many sex scenes. It might be only me but I felt that some of the sex scenes in the book weren't really necessary, but there we go. \n",
      " The last scene of the book...was too much. Out of everything, the belt scene was hard to read because why couldn't she just say stop? I understand that she asked Christian how bad it could be, but who in their right mind would continue to be whipped by a belt and count to six. \n",

      "\n",
      "I was prepared to hate this book. I didn't hate it, thankfully. It took me a while to read though because I was 'meh' about it. The writing style isn't fantastic, but I'd compare it to a lot of popular chick lit that I've enjoyed, so I'm not too bothered by that. I do think that James could benefit from expanding her vocabulary a bit. Oh my was way over used, for instance. And if one is writing erotica, referring to lady bits as something more specific than there seems in order. I'm no erotica writer though, so even I had to go with \"lady bits\". ;) \n",
      " So, as a reading experience, it was just OK, hence my rating of 3. \n",
      " The theme of this book really bothers me though. I did hate, at times, reading about this beautiful YOUNG woman beating herself up (mentally) because she could not meet what she perceived as Grey's needs. At times, actually seeming to think she *deserved* punishment, distance, control. Worrying herself into knots about angering him. It made me sad/mad to read about the mental torment this character was putting herself through. I know the author gave us some background into why Grey is so damaged, but it wasn't enough to make me feel OK about this girl's experiences with him. I won't be picking up the next two in the series, although I expect Grey's treatment of her will improve in those editions, based on the Twilight movies anyway. \n",

      "I was not in the right head space to read this. I mean, I wasn't expecting anything special, it's just where I've been lurking Fifty Shades is being mentioned, probably because of the movie, and I have a firm \"don't condemn a book you've never read\" rule. That said, I've been reading reviews of the book, watching \"Into the Woods\" where the most interesting character is killed after having an affair (that's what everyone brings up people, the revelation afterwards is not mentioned by half the people who discuss it. Of course women are going to bring it up. We know this sort of thing when you see it. And in a piece of work as big on symbolism and things not \"just happening\" having her die right after an affair reads like a moral or a flimsy way for the man to be able to get his character development), and then I read Bitten. \n",
      " As I said, I was not in the right head space to be reading this and take it as another fun romp of sheer idiocy like my weird love of Tiger's Curse. \n",
      " That, and this book hit a \"Hard Limit\" for me. One that I do have to bend admittedly because apparently guys that won't leave you alone until you date them is hot. But we've been pushing that lately haven't we? I believe I'm required by law to say I have nothing against Dom/Sub excetera. I'd say I've read stories about it, even people that live the lifestyle twenty-four seven at least during the weekends, and I've enjoyed them especially if the focus is on the psychology of the two participants. What about those roles is enticing to them. How they react to a society that does what Ana does and think it's kinky and wrong. But I feel that I'm like that person saying \"I'm not against homosexuals, I have plenty of homosexual friends\" and you read it and immediately assume the person is a homophobe. \n",
      " That said. Let's get into why I hated this book and loathed these characters. \n",
      " There's no plot. Read Twilight. It had more plot. This should have been the end of the series with Ana realizing she is not into what Chris is into and leaving him. Heartbreaking, but dating hardly ever works out as wonderfully the first time around. \n",
      " Ana. I had to quickly distance myself from this character, especially as she started reacting to Chris. She's written, whether intentionally or because she was based on Bella, to be an insert of whoever is reading this. But, she also has to have enough of a personality to exist, and also be the perfect fighting submissive girl there is. I am extremely passive, and even I was rolling my eyes at how Ana let's herself get pushed around. If you don't want to do it Ana, tell Kate. You have a slew of legitimate reasons to give her as why you shouldn't replace her (I am not a reporter and this guy might be offended that you sent someone with no background to interview him). Also, she came off as one of those girls who claims they don't have girlfriends because you can't stand how catty other girls are, and then goes on to say that the girl you met totally wasn't as hot as she thought she was. I could go on, but the big thing is her reactions to Chris's intrusions on her life. \n",
      " Which brings us to my \"Hard Limit\". I cannot tell you how many times I thought \"F*** you\" when Chris said or demanded something of Ana. Seriously, I would have dumped this guy so many times that he would have given up or tied me in his basement. Because I don't do stalker s*** and I don't do pressure for a relationship s***. Why? Because the one time I got close to getting into a relationship, I had a panic attack and at the perfect point to start a relationship, I turned the poor guy down. Bad enough. But for the next three months he pressured me to be in a relationship with him and to reconsider, and apparently he was joking for a month, but this pressure caused me to have constant panic attacks and anxiety. \n",
      " Guess what? Reading about a guy that stalks you, that tells you off for getting drunk and \"letting some guy take advantage of you\" and then gets you drunk so you agree with him, who follows you on plane when you need space, who constantly talks down to you about what you want sexually, who talks down to you about life choices to what you eat and wear, who starts acting like your dominant before you've agreed and signed the contract, that's not sexy, that's grounds for trying to find somewhere safe to hide away. I can't get into this fantasy. This is not a fantasy to me. This is a nightmare that causes me to wake up covered in sweat. I don't even get the people who say it supports Dom/sub culture. The book itself seems to hint that while spicing up your love life is good, this lifestyle is something that nobody in a serious relationship should consider as it is just a kink and vanilla sex is what you really want in a relationship and that people who like that stuff were abused as children. \n",
      " This book is uncomfortable. I don't and cannot like it. Chris is not a sex God to me. To me he is a person trapped in a circle of abuse, and Ana needs to dump him before she becomes a part of that circle, and hopefully grow up in the process and stop say \"down there\" when describing sex acts. Seriously, how is saying that at all sexy to anyone?\n",
      "\n",
      "I have never read a book like this. It was pretty intense from the start, the instant attraction between Grey and Ana. Then Grey's way of pursuing her, to the first date. Then they get closer and she starts staying with him and he brings her into his world. Quite creepy and scary at first but then you instead find it hot. But through all this Grey starts going against everything he believes in and all for Ana. You start to see his hard shaped demeanor crumble all for her, though he tries to maintain that persona. This book held a lot of erotic pleasure on things I wouldn't normally find erotic, or at least I wouldn't say out loud lol. Since most of us have our inner Dom or Sub or both. It was intense, it made me laugh, and after what she had asked of him to try to get him to open up to her more, failed. I cried, I cried through the rest of the book. I'm glad I have the other two books handy because after reading the ending of this book, I Have to move on there is no doubt about that. All in all this has been the best book I have ever read probably.\n",

      " I'd planned to skip out on this one, but predictably, even I couldn't escape the hype. The reasons I didn't want to read this book were mostly because I didn't know anything about it, and because it's an \"erotic\" fiction/romance novel. I won't deny I've delved into this genre before, but as comfortable as I am admitting I read Laurell K. Hamilton and Charlaine Harris, I don't want my degree in English Literature taken away from me before the signature dries... \n",
      " When I learned about it, my confusion deepened. Twilight fan fiction? Pass. I liked the Twilight series, for all of its flaws. I will defend it, cherish it, go see all of the terrible movies. But a BDSM bald-faced fic/rip-off? LOLWUT. \n",

      " Issues (outside of the blatant intellectual property violations)include, but are not limited to: \n",
      " 1) Jose. \n",
      " E.L. James chose to write a book with ONE person of color specified in it (Unless Leandra was too and I just missed it? Idk). She chose to include multiple references to character appearance and background. Therefore, she also chose to make Jacob-I mean Jose, an incredibly stereotyped Mexicano, spicy Latin non-entity. \n",
      " I didn't like how he was written, but I don't want to get into it because in order to not stick my foot in my mouth I would need to dredge up a decent amount of research about the linguistic habits of first generation Americans bilingual in Spanish and English and how often they actually slip into Spanglish while assaulting their friends... \n",
      " He is supposed to be Ana's good friend of 4 years? Really? And suddenly after four years of devoted friendship he becomes pushy and can't take \"no\" for an answer? Whatever, E.L. James. \n",
      " 2) The Britishisms. \n",
      " The only explanation I will accept for what is obviously the oversight of a very lazy and/or inept editor is that Ana may or may not be an Anglophile and an unreliable narrator, given her love of Brit lit, and misquotes everyone around her with very colloquial, region specific British English. \n",
      " Ana (and ostensibly, everyone else in the book) is American. E.L. James is British. If you are going to write a narrative with an American narrator it is kind of imperative you understand the differences in speech. Brits (and Ana) put bacon \"under the grill.\" Americans put bacon ON the grill (range, stove?), usually in a pan, so you don't start a grease fire. This deviation in culinary descriptives happened at some point across the Atlantic, and while Americans can appreciably understand that homegirl is making bacon, they are definitely going to raise an eyebrow at the unfamiliar terminology (which probably is more to do with different cooking implements than actual bacon location, but whatev). \n",
      " In the same strain: Americans use the word crap as a noun, usually, not an adjective. It is rare to hear an American twenty-something say she's watching \"crap TV\" or that she is \"crap at [verb].\" \n",
      " I will not go into the dialogue and things because I'm sure someone else has already addressed it exhaustively. \n",
      " 3. The sex was not exceptionally written. \n",
      " So there was sex. Cool. Was it exciting? Not really. What kept me reading was waiting to see if this girl was going to come to her senses and realize she is in an abusive relationship and get the eff out! \n",
      " Also, I know everyone is different, but I find it very hard to believe that a virgin can just magically be good at sex (especially with zero prior experience with her body or the male body at all) and feel no residual soreness. Not impossible, but, still. Unlikely. \n",
      " 4. Finally, the avoidance of the word VAGINA. \n",
      " COME ON. This book is an erotic take on Twilight. Y U NO SAY VAGINA? I remember reading someone who had counted up the number of times the words \"down there\" are used...in italics...it was a lot. Sure, she says clitoris, okay. But what's wrong with vagina? I'm tired of hearing about your \"sex.\" \n",
      " Also, unrelated, I got creeped out early in with the usage of \"Miss Steele.\" It just feels creepy older man lecherous. Maybe this is another cultural thing? As far as I'm aware, most Americans, even very well raised polite ones, default to the informal first name when introducing themselves to acquaintances. Maybe not at job interviews, or press interviews, but the honorific is dropped pretty quickly once a relationship is established. \n",

      "Hace como dos anos lei cierto comentario de una chica en Facebook (si, ando mucho por ahi) donde estaba criticando la trilogia y a quien leia Grey--que cuando eso hacia dias de su publicacion. Entonces me fui y busque el primer libro en Goodreads, ?Adivinen que consegui? !!!Su resena!!! ?y saben que mas? !!!Le dio 5 estrellas!!! \n",
      " Fue hace casi cuatro anos, en 2013, transcurria el ultimo dia del mes de Febrero. Recuerdo todo muy perfecto y vengo a contar los motivos que me llevo en ese entonces a leer la trilogia. Estaba en clases (segundo ano de medicina) y dos companeros (una chica, Gen, y un chico; Joha) empezaron a hablar de dichos libros, de que habian escuchado que trataba de algo asi como la vida sexual de Bella y Edward. Eso fue lo que inmediatamente capto mi atencion, lo reconozco. Muy Twilighter de corazon yo, tambien. A los dias ya habia empezado a leer Fifty Shades of Grey. Me llevo una semana terminar de leerlos y me encanto. Totalmente. Era algo absolutamente fascinante para mi, algo nuevo, arriesgado y, ademas, me estrenaba con la literatura erotica. Tenia tan solo dieciocho anos y cai absolutamente prendada de Christian Grey, si, eso, ademas. \n",
      " Han pasado ya anos... Genesis tambien los leyo, y bueno, Johander no, el si fue absolutamente sincero conmigo y me dijo que del beso en el ascensor no pudo pasar. \n",
      " Lo que queria decir es que si, mis gustos han cambiado desde entonces. La tematica BDSM no es mi favorita, otros eroticos me exasperan, hay New adult's que me amargan la vida, unos muy rosa para mi gusto. Todo muy distinto, distintos gustos, distintos estados de animo. Asimismo, me volvi mas exigente conmigo misma, deje de perder tiempo en sandeces, pretender que toda lo que esta de moda me guste, me pido leer mas clasicos, cosas atrevidas... \n",
      " Y lo que queria decir sobre el comentario al inicio: Esta muy mal, chicos. O sea, los gustos de cada quien se respetan, pero sean fieles a si mismos. Esta bien que te guste algo que a los demas no, no hay porque sentirse avergonzado, simplemente reconocerlo; son tus gustos. Hay que estar comodo, sentirse complacido. Nada como conseguir eso que te satisface. Asi no sea lo que se espera. Como esta perfectamente bien exigirse, leer mas, pero hacerlo para y por nosotros mismos. No porque sea moda ni por querer ser popular ni agradar a todos. \n",

Since I hate waiting, I decided to read the books instead of the films. The books started as a fan-fantasy based on Twilight and I have to say E.L. James really adapted Meyer's writing style. Lots of repetition, a very shallow main character and a story that could have been told in one book, but got three instead.\n",

      " Everything about the story was beautiful, and the erotica, romance, humor and thrill were nicely interwoven in equal doses. I liked that the main characters were young, so they could get away with a lot of things, from behavior, to dialogue, to childishness, and to mischief, which would have been weird for older characters. \n",
      " The characters were believable, although most of the stories seemed more like a fairytale than reality, like the whole helicopter scenes and the perfectness of each character in their own way... everything just seemed to be perfect, even flaws were painted beautifully... tears and crying sounded so nice and perfect you would want to cry yourself. I read one part of the book almost ten times and a scene in it gave me an idea for the realistic fiction story I was currently working on. I would never have imagined getting an idea from an erotica book for a realistic fiction... but I'm convinced that ideas can come from anywhere as long as we keep reading. \n",
      " To me, \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" is not your average 100% erotica book with no story, only sex, as I initially thought. It's a nice story with an erotic flavour, which I didn't want to end... so I was sad to see an ending. I also thought the ending was fine, with... (I don't want to give spoilers), because I believe that all good things can either remain as they are or come to an end... whichever is acceptable to me as long as there is a reason for it. I thought the book ended well and wondered why there was a second, and a third volume. I can't think of anything more to add to the story, but I have added them to my to-read list. \n",

      " Why, oh why, is the hype on 50 Shades off the charts? I don't understand it. If women (or whoever) want to read some kinky stuff, that's actually well written, why not check out Anne Rice? She's clever, her ideas are original and her characters complex and intriguing. The S&M stuff is not new people!! That being said, I'm disappointed in 50 Shades for the following reasons: \n",
      " A. I failed to read the reviews (yes, my own fault - I'll make sure to send myself to the Red Room of Pain later), therefore, I unknowingly entered into the depths of tragically poor writing and I PAID for the book to boot! \n",
      " B. I knew nothing about this book other than the fact that it had people buzzing (I failed to read the reviews you see). As I'm reading, I realize that certain aspects (i.e. character flaws of which there are many) are reminiscent of Edward and Bella, a couple from a certain Saga. You may have heard of it. \n",
      " C. When I have about oh, 90 or so pages remaining, I decide to look this puppy up on Goodreads. What I find is shocking, indeed. This was apparently Twilight fan fiction, I'm guessing a lot of people read it so James decided to change the names, tweak some details, and publish it. Now it's a bestseller, and I am partly to blame. I will have to carry that with me to the grave. \n",
      " D. Christian Grey is a major tool, and Ana is too. \n",
      " E. This is based in Seattle, and I'm fairly certain all the characters are American. That being said, it sure is packed full of British slang and lingo. I also didn't know the Brits were so obsessed with bloody Converse. So sorry for the shouty capitals but NOT EVERYONE IN THIS COUNTRY WEARS CONVERSE! The lingo plus the Converse obsession is very distracting. \n",

There were some interesting word choices though and I have to say, the author did manage to keep me guessing about what would happen next and the general story line was decently written. Perhaps if I weren't do disturbed by the plot, I might rate it one star higher. There were, however, some serious flaws with the character development and some of the actions of the characters and responses made no sense. I don't want to give anything away so I'll leave it vague. \n",
      " What it boils down to - if you want to read this book because you feel like you should so you know what this best seller is all about, I would recommend settling for a summary - it's a romance novel about a multi-millionaire who gets his kicks hitting women and then making them feel like they deserve it and a woman with no self-esteem who seems to think its ok if it makes the guy happy. However, if you are truly interested in reading it, by all means, do. But note - this book is not for the overly sensitive. Heck, I'm not even that sensitive and I was rather disturbed. Bottom line - tread carefully.\n",

      "Honestly, why I interested to read this book from the very beginning is because it keeps appear in the first page of Periplus.com; online bookstore where I always buy my books. Besides, the glimpse of the cover gave me impression of mystery novel; some kinds of James Patterson's. But well, for those who have read the book will know that this book is nothing like that at all. \n",
      " I've read some romantic almost similar novels like Ella Fox's but there is actually a story there and the character is quite realistic. Ana Steele is a mess with low self-esteem and Christian Gray is creepy - gosh, he might be beautiful but he has issue. Just one thing I agree with Ana, that Gray really subjected her as the *ho, no matter how much he said that it is not true. Does he know that women also need to have power while he prefers Dominant and Submissive stuff? Who the hell he thinks he is? \n",
      " It is true that I've written once that this kind of novel not required critique because it is for the sake of reading pleasure only. However, I didn't enjoy the story and now I know why the book always appears in the first page of Periplus.com because it is actually in discount display along with some more novels that required more publication to push the selling. \n",

      " I also watch the movie and stopped at the first 20 min, it was awfully horrible, all the cast are emotionless and blabbing the stupid script in no where! Thankfully it didn't scratch the book, because readers have brain to know the difference between masterpiece and trash! \n",

The main girl Ana is clumsy, poor, and virginal while the main guy is older, rich, suave, controlling, and stalkerish. And the writing style was terrible. I wish I had an electronic version of this so I could do a \"find\" and see how many times the verb \"murmured\" was in used. I counted four times by three different characters within 1.5 pages. And that was in the third chapter. \n",
      " The plot was ok and the main characters had chemistry even if it did seem a little forced at times. The sex scenes weren't quite as racy as I thought they'd be. I think they talked about doing racier things than what actually happened. Maybe that's part of the appeal. \n",

He has issues and sometimes he shouldn't have dialogue, because it's just awkward coming out of a person's mouth. Actually now that I think of it, some of the scenes throughout this series are awkward too. The main character Ana, has issues herself. I feel that she only loves him out of pity from his upbringing. The ending of this book; in my opinion, needs to be rewritten. No one likes a cry fest/ pity party to end a book. This shows how weak she is as our protagonist. I had one of those over a guy before and it resulted in a marathon of the Twilight movies. That's very fitting for this book( published fanfiction). I got over that person, so she should too.

I mean the things that Christian does to Ana is pretty intense (I think that's pretty mild).

      "I borrowed Fifty Shades of Grey from my local library so that I wouldn't think of myself as a hypocrite if I ever commented on how crap or not it is. Lots of my friends and family enjoyed it, including my nanna, so what was the harm? The majority of the downloads on my Kindle are erotica and I thought I would at least enjoy the sex, but I can't say it had any effect on me in any way. This is yet another example of a series blown way out of proportion and now the general public has read it, it isn't so popular. \n",
      " I can see what people mean when they say that this book is just a re-write of Twilight. I saw the first Twilight film, then read all the books, then saw the rest of the films as they were released. I'm not a Twi-fan, but the books were okay. This was 'amazingly' complete garbage in comparison. Ana's personality and the way she looks is exactly the same as Bella's, and Christian's wealth and wanting to protect Ana etc is of course the Edward in him. Ana (Bella) spends the book trying to save Christian (Edward) from himself even though this time she could be spanked, whipped, or flogged because of it. \n",
      " I've only ever rated a book as 1 star before and that was a book I didn't finish. I returned this book yesterday after having sped-read almost all of it and I can still say everything that happened. It was incredibly poorly written with pages upon pages of uninspiring and drab sex. Anybody claiming that this book is the reason their sheets are steamy is lying, or they have very low standards, because the thought of having your tampon pulled out and a penis shoved inside your bleeding and internally raging vagina doesn't do it for me. \n",
      " One of the major problems I had with this book is that Christian uses BDSM to cover up his abusive personality. I think it is very insulting to people who genuinely enjoy that thing and enjoy doing it well. Christian even says several times that he wants to hurt Ana, but she will enjoy it! It is almost a fact that it is not just for play because she is actually scared of him and cries after sex, but she can't get away when he uses his stalker tendencies to find her. \n",
      " Thankfully Ana enjoyed the vanilla (straight-up) sex that she and Christian shared, and you can't tell me that she didn't also like coming home and finding a MacBook that she hadn't paid a cent for. Or the new car. Or any of the other things that she wouldn't get if she wasn't in some sort of screwed idea of a relationship with Christian. It's grooming at it's finest. Or her using him. Whatever. Anna's 'inner goddess' should always steer her in the right direction sexual related, although if I made the film I would've made that thing like a little animated Lizzie MgGuire. \n",
      " Ana had absolutely no desire to sleep with anyone before she met Christian, with all his chains and whips and wealth. It can't hurt that he was obviously carved from marble, but again it is a very unlikely scenario and one that grated on me massively. If you are such a plain Jane and no one other than a billionaire will ever fancy you again, you would let them whip you in the hope that it would fix them right? I watched the film when I had read a couple of chapters in the hope that it would help me understand a bit more, but no. The film has an even lower IMDB rating than the book does on here and rightly so. \n",
      " My goodness I would've had fun if I could've taken to this book with a highlighter. I would keep one colour just for all the times the word 'tenacious' was used.

      " Let me see... Where do I begin? I read this book to see what the hype was all about. Wish I hadn't. \n",
      " This book is all kinds of wrong. Let's start with the writing. It pompous, full of big sounding words that do not go with the simple prose and setting of the story or the characters. It's as if the writer wanted to equal or at least honor the effortless, yet perfect prose of Austen. Instead, it comes across as the writings of an overly needy girl on the sexual front trying to fulfill a very twisted fantasy. It is repetitive, extremely dull and full of big words that sound off key and out of place. \n",
      " Now, for the story. \n",
      " I will not address the depravity of Christian's psyche, or his evident psychiatric problems. I will, however address the stupidity of Anastasia Steele's creation. How is it possible that in this age, a character of such blandness and just plain idiocy has been created by a female author? \n",
      " Is this really what women around the world want in a relationship? An overly controlling boyfriend with jealousy issues that border on psychotic behavior? A stalker who likes to subdue women to the point of hitting them for pleasure? \n",
      " I am utterly amazed and, to be honest, appalled at the extent this book makes everything in sex and love a horrible, disgusting, depressing experience. Consider this carefree independent girl who knows what she wants and is happy with her life. In comes the psycho to make her life a living hell. He possesses her in every way possible without letting her have much of a say in it, manipulates her and makes her a slave of his needs. She cries all the time, and yet she continues to go back to him like a beaten dog to an abusive owner. Because make no mistake, this book is about an ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP! \n",
      " Codependent, neglectful, controlling and sexually ill. That, women, is who Christian Gray is. \n",
      " Now, for the sex description. Call it what you may but this is written porn. I can see the allure of this book, it makes for a good companion for the repressed sexuality of a lot of women, but you must know women, this is NOT what sex is supposed to be like. Fucking, like Gray says, that is what this book is about. NOT LOVE, NOT MAKING LOVE. Depraved sex, and why depraved? Not because of the practices they engage in, but because of the nature of the NEEDS Christian Gray has. He is a sick, sick man. Someone who should not engage in sexual intercourse with an innocent, stupid child-woman who is so inexperienced she confuses obsession with happiness, and love with a horrible, depressive need to please a sick man. \n",
      " I kept waiting for Steele to realize how awfully unhappy she was. I wished so much for her to empower herself and leave this pompous bastard and never look back. After skipping all the sex scenes from about half of the book (seriously, how much of this can you take???? It's FAKE FAKE FAKE and soooo WRONG) I get to the end scene where he spanks her so hard she finally realizes the extent of his depravity. But, instead of leaving, she sleeps in the same bed!!!!! \n",
      " She manages to leave him, kudos to her. And imagine my surprise when I ask someone how there can be two more books, since in my brain, that would be the end of that nightmare, and my friend tells me she not only gets back together with him, but also has a child with him and marries him!!!!!! \n",
      " This book is trash. Garbage tailored to play with the insecurities of every woman and perfectly chauvinistic at heart. It saddens me to say I share the gender with this author. \n",
      " Needless to say, I wish I had never ever read this book. One star is far too high a rating for such a thing. It is the farthest thing from literature I have ever encountered.\n",
      "\n",
      "The very hyped, erotic novel by E.L. James, Fifty Shades of Grey, is about a college graduate who falls in love with Dominant and CEO Christian Grey. Anastasia Steele, the literature major, is introduced to BDSM (and all things sexual) by this man. She struggles to understand why he is into BDSM and to make him realize \"more\" is good. \n",
      " Anastasia is very innocent, almost annoyingly so. When she realizes she actually has a crush and lust for a man, she suddenly starts listening to her \"inner goddess.\" This inner goddess is lust-driven. I was annoyed by Ana's constant \"Oh my!\" Every time she said or thought it, I kept hearing it said the way George Takei said it. Her main issue is that she wants a flowers-hearts-and-chocolates man instead of a dominant. I had to laugh that Christian was mostly wrong in his first-impression of her as a submissive person. When she was introduced to the Red Room of Pain, I like the first thing she says in reaction to the room: \"Do you do this to people or do they do it to you?\" (99). \n",
      " Christian is dominant in all areas of his life. When he meets Ana, he immediately knows that she is innocent but not how innocent. He tries to make her understand that he is not the man she wants him to be. This doesn't stop either of them from pursuing a relationship. Christian is free with his money. He is also strongly against being touched; Ana agonizes over what could have happened to him as a child to hate touch so much. A plus to her character is that she doesn't adopt BDSM as her philosophy for everything. \n",
      " There are a lot of graphic sex scenes. Not unexpected considering the genre. The scenes are well-written. They do not dominate the book. The whole plot is not sex. It was gripping from beginning to end, especially in the portions that were not explicitly sex. \n",
      " I do see why the novel was written in first person and present tense. It's erotica. It probably wouldn't be as popular nor good if it were written in past tense and any other person. \n",
      " When Ana and Christian communicate through e-mail, remember to pay attention to the subject lines and how Christian signs each e-mail. One of the phrases I loved was Ana describing the use of \"shouty capitals.\" \n",
      " I originally thought this book was over-hyped. And I was put off when I learned it was originally a Twilight fan fiction; I did see a couple sentences that could be Bella Swan as Anastasia, but it never came off as fan fiction. I was wrong. This is a great book. It was enthralling. General rule of thumb: this is for readers 18 and up.\n",
      "\n",
      "I started reading 50 Shades of Grey to find out if all the hub-bub swirling around about it was accurate. For me and this recommendation it was delightedly worth it. The 50 Shades trilogy (I am currently immersed in book two of the series) has already been added to my books I hold dear to my heart. Not for the erotic scenes it was fanned about all over the media but because it has that incandescent spark that a reader finds only so often in a truly beloved book (or series). Some of those for me, to name a few, would be Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, A Discovery of Witches, Outlander, The Hunger Games Trilogy, and The Harry Potter Series. \n",
      " The characters have realness to them, mainly Ana and Christian, which puts the reader at ease. E L James has created great chemistry between these unlikely lovers. For me, I loved reading about what they saw in each other, Ana falling into Christian's office, Ana and Christian stumbling over each other to find an anchor within each other. While Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey may not the new Mr Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet or even Claire and Jamie, they are, for me at least and I hope for others, right up there. I have fallen into their world and am rooting for them, commiserating with them, laughing, sighing, and melting as their story and journey unfolds. They have that quality about them that has me rooting for them despite the odds, hang-ups, fun e-mailing, and S&M tendencies. \n",
      " This book is classified as an erotic novel. I have read others and it was just soft core or hard core sex set in scenes, much like a porn flick. The 50 Shades trilogy (so far at least and definitely in this first book) is realistic and the situation Ana finds herself in with Christian's offer, while unique, is believable. The sex is not \"the story\" but an important component of it. The sex is delicious and leaves one panting. James has an incredible sexual voice, giving the reader sensations, feelings, textures. James is able to give the reader \"vanilla sex\" and then sex with a \"kinky f***ery\" twist. For me I appreciated the full out rawness of it. An author either needs to get into the sex scenes or give you a beginning and then an \"afterglow\", a rated PG-13 or rated R movie if you will allow that as a comparison. \n",
      " 50 Shades of Grey, for the mature audiences out there, is a must read. For many, including myself, this trilogy is a new adventure and I am definitely learning about things I never would have dreamed of (in a good way). That said, pour yourself a glass of wine and curl up with this great book.\n",

      " This is not just a story of a young, bright, inexperienced college girl falling for an extremely handsome, broody, wealthy, dominating man. It's the story of 2 people so completely different trying their hardest to be what the other needs to make their relationship flourish. It's a story, seen through Ana's eyes, which quickly became my own. I breathed when she breathed, I cursed when she cursed and I cried while she cried. First loves are often awkward and erratic. This was no different. Every emotion that Ana went through was completely on point. She often thought of how crazy it seemed to be with a man who was so intense, so insanely possesive and so dominant. I think this is why I liked Ana so much. She knew what she was feeling, and was completely honest when it came to her confusion, her desire and her heart. The feelings that Christian's character invoked in me was unreal! I could not get enough of the enigma that was Christian Grey. *sigh* Now, about Christian. You all know that I looooove my male characters to have issues that are so deep that even their issues have issues. Well, DING, DING, DING!!!! WE HAVE A WINNER!!!!! Christian is a troubled man. I have no other word to use, as plain as it may be. He is simply trouble/troubled to the 10th power and he makes no bones about it. He is what he is. He too, is completely honest and haunting. He tries soooo hard to be what Ana wants him to be. While I think back on the many times he experiences his \"firsts\" with Ana, it makes me want to tear up. He, who feels so hard, unloveable and tortured, was softened by this young girl--her touch and her heart sung to him in ways that he'd never heard. *sigh* \n",
      " **SPOILER** \n",
      " The BDSM in this book was dark but beautiful. The ending was an exception for me and had me very twisted up!! (I am only going to describe the last intimate scene) It wasn't Christian that I was upset with. It was Ana. Grrrrr!!! I was so upset at her! Her reaction!!! WHY DIDN'T SHE USE HER SAFE WORD?!?!?! I mean, I know that she was trying so hard....to be what he needed. But he never ever made her feel like she wasn't in control. With every hit, it drove her further and further away from him. If he had only known that she hated every moment of it...... *shakes head* I know he would have stopped, would have held her and apologized. He would have done that for her, because she was simply Anastasia, the girl who bewitched him in ways that noone else had. I totally get it tho, in regards to why Ana didn't use her safe word. She wanted it so badly, not the beating, but just to be close to Christian in the only way she knew how. Maybe she was too stubborn to use it?? Maybe she just forgot that it was an option for her?? Regardless, it was what broke the proverbial camel's back and caused her to run as far away from him as she could. And I think that's why her leaving upsets me. She knew how he was...how he would be. Then she leaves him all alone after he pours his heart out to her. With every hit, he was showing her what it felt like when people touched him. Then she just couldn't handle it and left him...left him!!! I was just reeling...still reeling!! I will add that it ended the way that I thought it would. With one or both heartbroken. But I didn't realize that I would be included! :(( I can't wait to read the next book and see just how long she can go without Christian in her life. I'm betting that it won't be too long and that he's just as miserable as she will surely be.\n",

Ana -- the so-called heroine -- is stupider than a bag of rocks and the 'hero' is a creep. They're made for each other, and I wouldn't have cared if one of them had killed the other and eaten him or her. What bothers me is how after decades of work to get women in fiction presented as men's equals, we now have women oohing and ahing over What'sis'name... Fifty Shades... like he was some great romantic hero. He's a pervert who likes to tie women up and whip them. And Ana goes along with it because he's a billionaire.

Then I began reading many reviews on the book and couldn't believe the number of ladies who totally wanted a Christian in their life. Really! After reading the book I don't get it. How is it so many women find a crazy, controlling, emotionally unavailable character attractive? At the other end of the spectrum the author creates \"the heroine - Ana\". Clearly describing her as a strong intelligent woman who manages to in hours/ days completely and willingly to against her character. I would think someone of her moral fibre would have had many more doubts and reservations about throwing herself into a lifestyle of someone who clearly isn't all there. \n",
      " The actual story line was interesting when the two characters were dialoging and you got some insight into Christian personality. Unfortunately the amount of diaglogue and actually story was told in a total of maybe two chapters. The rest of the book was about the sex. The author when writing the sexual parts of the story changed writing styles and I found it frustrating and boring to read because the similar details and internal dialogue were repeated over and over again. I'd like to get a copy of this book in a format where I could search on \"he cocked his head\", \"she bit her lip\", \"eat\", \"holy fuck\", \"holy crap\", and \"crap\". I bet the word count for just these would be massive. \n",
      " While reading the book I felt like I was reading an over the top somewhat risque harlequin romance based on a combination of \"Pretty Woman\" and \"Twilight\". I got the impression these were the authors two favorite love stories and felt much of the story and lines were taken from one or both. In the end as Ana started looking for a job I was starting to get the impression we might get a bit of the \"Flashdance\" storyline as well with the over controlling lover influencing her ability to get a job (instead of into a dance school). \n",
      " The only redeeming part of this book was in the end when Ana finally decides to leave Christian the author intoned enough emotion into her decision that it made me weep a little. Unfortunately I'm a sucker for series books and therefore will finish what I started to see where the author takes these two characters. Friends have assured me the next two books are more about the story line and I hope they are being honest. Otherwise I may give up before reading the third book. \n",
      " All in all a very disappointing read. Thankfully it was an easy quick read.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I read this book. I wish I could tell you why. My attempt to explain follows. \n",
      " 1. It is the January pick for The Banging Book Club, a book club podcast I follow. \n",
      " 2. I have been hating on it for years without having read it, so maybe it was time. Not because I thought the experience would tell me I was wrong, but so I could hate it in more detail. \n",
      " 3. There was a copy available through Overdrive when I was finally setting that up / figuring out how that worked despite being a librarian and talking about the app in depth for two years. \n",
      " Anyway, needless to say, I didn't enjoy it. It was so poorly written (this wasn't a surprise to me). I do know the whole \"written as Twilight fan fiction\" thing. I have read my fair share of fan fiction, and most of it is better written than this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ugh. This is an author desperately in need of an editor. Every use of \"Oh my\" is an aggravating shortcut. Not to mention the story itself. I'll read Nicolson Baker next time I want weird erotica.\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand why people are so enthralled with it, because it's a pretty steamy read, to say the least. That being said, it's poorly written, the vocabulary is exceptionally limited, and there are definite issues of gender roles/submissive women if that is a subject you are sensitive to. \n",

      "\n",
      "Best be believin'... :)\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't usually write reviews, but thought I would write a little for this one. Yep, I had to see what all the hype was about and after finishing the first in the series, I am not sure. Definitely not as shocking as I thought it would be when it comes to the sex. I have read kinker, more erotic stuff. Not sure what that says about me or others. And I am not sure why people are saying it is a ripoff of the Twilight series. No vamps or wolves in these books and nothing even close to the sex that is in these books in the Twilight ones. \n",
      " I did not love this book, but did not find it so bad that I could not finish it. I had a hard time with the writing at first and at other times in the book. Found it stilting. However, I managed to get past that and enjoy the actual story of the two main characters and look forward to seeing what happens with them in the next two books.\n",

      "Meh - I just wasn't super hooked by it. Ana's voice was obnoxious. Christians character was the most interesting, but it was still just, a meh kind of story.\n",

      " Wow, those poor sheltered NYC housewives. I swear I've heard episodes of A Prairie Home Companion that were more shocking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blimey! This was intense. \n",
      " This is the story on Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey - I love the combination of their surnames. Steely grey is most definitely the colour of Christian's eyes. \n",
      " Ana and Christian meet and there is an intense connection between. Christian is a rich man, unaccustomed to not getting his way, and after initially warning Ana off him, pursues her in earnest. Turns out Christian has a dark, carnal side and is a dominant and wants Ana as his submissive. She's horrified at first but agrees to give the whole matter some thought. Their relationship deepens and is told from Ana's point of view for the entire novel - she's very 'real'. She suffers from all the same insecurities as the rest of us and is rather bashful. \n",
      " She is falling in love with him and I have no doubt that he is in love with her but Christian's past doesn't allow him to recognise his feelings and he just believes that he wants to possess Ana - we know better, right? \n",
      " Her eventual foray into submission is protracted, hard fought by Christian, over-thought by Ana and ultimately beautiful but Christian's needs are darker than Ana has bargained for - can she tolerate his demands or will it all be too much for her? \n",
      " We know quite a lot about Ana as she is the narrator but Christian's history is drip-fed and sparse. I want to know how he ended up being quite so wealthy, so young. Christian kind of reminded me of a frozen river - serene and calm on the outside but with deep running and battling undercurrents beneath the surface. He's definitely fifty shades of conflicted and a product of his past experiences that are slowly and rarely revealed to us. \n",
      " Ana is his polar opposite - all her emotions are on show and she is not a natural born submissive. She is cheeky and sasses Christian at almost every opportunity - she can't help herself and I found their banter and their emails very funny. \n",
      " I know this started out life as a Twilight fan-fic and you can see the parallels but the intense and turbulent emotional journey felt a little bit more like the movie Nine and a Half Weeks. \n",
      " I'm so glad that it says 'end of part one' at the end of the novel - the last few pages were emotionally draining and I have to confess that I sobbed all through them. I don't think I have cried at many books and the last one was Birdsong! \n",
      " Only one way to get over this - read the next one which is exactly what I am about to do. \n",
      " Thanks you Ms James - this is the best book I have read in a while. :-)\n",
      "\n",
      "If it was possible to rate books in negative numbers that's what I would do with \"Fifty Shades of Grey.\" \n",
      " I thought \"Twilight\" was a terrible series that degraded women and created expectations of the opposite sex more damaging than what Disney is accused of. But I was able to at least read that series through-and-through before wishing I could take those hours of my life back. With this book, it was a struggle to get through the first novel. I cannot imagine myself reading the following two books, nor plan on reading them either. \n",
      " I would love someone to explain to me how having a possessive, asshole of a human being as a \"boyfriend\" (when at the beginning, Anastasia Steele has that name only in name only, she's more of his personal sex toy) is at all empowering and \"freeing\" to women? \n",
      " Furthermore, Anastasia Steele is an idiot who has absolutely *no* self-respect. She has a better GPA than Bella Swan, but what she makes up for in supposed academics, she most certainly lacks multitudes over in commonsense. \n",
      " Who the heck gives their virginity to a complete stranger? Much less a stranger who flatly tells her that he would take pleasure in doing dark (and potentially damaging) things to her? No girl in their sane mind would ever consent to something like this, and if they did, they need help. Hence, Anastasia Steele isn't sane. She's just magnificently stupid, reeking of insecurity and lack of self-worth. \n",
      " Just because Christian Grey was abused as a child, doesn't mean that it's sexy that he basically abuses, stalks and attempts to posses Anastasia. At least, Edward Cullen had qualms about sleeping with Bella Swan and loved her enough to technically leave her for her own good. As screwed up as \"Twilight\" is, \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" actually makes that completely messed up relationship of Edward Cullen/Bella Swan look normal. \n",
      " Without saying much more, because I can feel my blood pressure rising from anger, I'll agree with Sir Salman Rushdie on this one -- \"I've never read anything so badly written that got published. It made 'Twilight' look like 'War and Peace.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Only a few friends of mine know that I have read this book. I thought I would ignore this book on this website, but I've seen too many girls around school flaunting this book and how \"good\" it is. Originally I wanted to read this because everyone was talking about how horrifically awful it is. I swear I died every time she referred to \"down there\" or her \"inner goddess.\" Like really? \n",
      " Also, I've read Twilight, and it is common knowledge (or I believe it is/should be) that this is Twilight fan-fiction. I could see so many parallels between the series. There's a \"bad boy\" who warns the \"average\" protagonist to stay away, that \"secret\" that only close friends and family know about, and about a million signs that point to an abusive relationship. \n",
      " I tried to get my way through the series, but I couldn't. By the time I got to the third book, I was bored of the same, monotonous happenings of Steele and Gray's relationship. \n",

      "I hate giving this book three stars. The writing is unpolished and repetitive. The characters can be one-dimensional and annoying. And the story has a weird cadence that gives a lot of attention to mundane things and glances over more important subjects. \n",
      " Despite all that, this book held my attention amazingly well. The characters can be so frustrating, stupid, and screwed up sometimes you want to throw things at the wall. At other times, those same characters manage to completely hypnotize you. The story is twisted and romantic, powerful and disgusting all at the same time. \n",
      " This book is poorly written, badly (if at all), edited and not what I am used to from mainstream publishing of romance or any other type of literature. That doesn't mean that it isn't a fun and sexy read. \n",
      " It isn't for the average reader. It describes multiple BDSM scenes and explicit sexual encounters. Despite labeling as erotica in the media this book is no more erotica than most paranormal romance or bodice-rippers on the market today.

This is the first book I did not bother to complete. \n",
      " Blazer clad uncouth barbarian is how I want to describe Christian Grey. Anatasia, I've never hated a fictional character as much as I hated you.

      "I must say I only read this book because of all the hype. \n",
      " There are so many things wrong with it. I don't understand why it is such a big deal. Erotica and bdsm are not uncharted territory. There have been many books with those elements that are much better written. \n",
      " The first thing that struck me is the language. This book is set in Seattle, but it is obvious the author is English. Phrases and terminology that are frequently used, such as the repeated use of the word bloody as a swear word, are not used by Americans in that context. It may come across as me nit picking here but it's one of my pet peeves. \n",

I just finished it. It's November 2014. Yes it took me a complete year. Fifty Shades of Grey is complete garbage and I couldn't stand more than a chapter at a time. Apparently tons of people have horrible taste and no self-respect. \n",
      " It baffles me how so many people enjoy this book and swoon over Christian's character. He's a controlling stalker. I don't care if he has grey eyes and is rich. No amount of hotness or money can make up for his fugly personality. \n",
      " There's so many things that were so stupid. I don't even know where to start. \n",
      " First of all, why the fuck were they always e-mailing. :S No one e-mails like that... They were almost cyber e-mailing at one point... Why was she not using the blackberry to text him? (Mess at Blackberry those are so 2009) Not that money is an issue for Christian *rolls eyes* but if that was the reason there's still BBM or other apps with free texting. \n",
      " Their conversations were so cringe worthy and unrealistic too. (Well I hope unrealistic, if anyone talks to the person they are fucking like that I feel bad for them, really.) Another cringe thing is when she talks about her \"inner goddess.\" :S \n",
      " The whole contract thing pissed me off. Actually no. Anastasia agreeing is what pissed me off. She takes the cake on being the dumbest bitch character in all of the books I've ever read. The contract had something about when to eat and no snacking between meals unless it's fruit. Oh and you have to exercise 4 times a week. (Later it changes it to 3 times a week but still babes, no boy should ever tell you what to eat, when to eat, how much to eat, and when to exercise. I don't care if I'm feminist, I'm proud of it.) \n",
      " Anastasia doesn't even seem to like BDSM which makes this book even worse. It's like gross to read from her point of view. Maybe it would have been better his point of view. She's like scared of him and puts up with the BDSM just so he doesn't leave her. It's honestly so pathetic. And no I'm not a prude. A little spanking and rough sex is hot.. if both people are enjoying it. \n",
      " I don't know if it's just me but lately I find main girl characters annoying as fuck. Like get your own clothes bitch.

      "Do you want to know why this book sold millions of copy, although in most's opinion the writing was poor? E.L. James didn't do anything new. She actually tapped into what has been selling good romance books for years. What is it, you ask? The good 'ol hopeless girl being saved by Captain Save A...chicken? No! Well, you know how that saying truly goes, so no need finishing it, least I receive a million emails from goobers scouting reviews to find the ones they feel aren't politically correct. \n",
      " Let's begin the review, shall we? \n",
      " If I'm assuming correctly, most women don't give much of a hoot for Anastasia, but what they can relate to is her innocence. Regardless of what is being said of today's women, most women ARE innocent, too fearful to be labeled, abused, misunderstood. We're good girls, if not by nature then by Mother's steely disapproving eye of any daughter who would bring a bad name on the family. And for those who have tested the waters, no doubt, will keep this a secret from others. So what did E.L. James give us? A virginal, pretty girl-next-door type who is finishing her college degree when chance introduces her to Mr. ALL Time Badness just before graduation. Graduation is the key here, folks! It signifies a new chapter, new beginnings, a step closer to wisdom. And what is Anastasia's new beginning? Yes! Getting rid of that little maidenhead that society now believes shouldn't exist for women in their twenties. And why? Because it symbolizes she has not, as of yet, become a REAL woman. Don't bash me all of you who believes there is no such symbolism. Ahem! This a book. Fiction at that. Stop taking it too serious. \n",
      " Now where was I? Oh, yes! Anastasia, after meeting Christian Grey, is ready to step into untreaded waters until she's fully submerged from her toenails to each itty bitty hair follicle on her pretty auburn head. Why? It has nothing to do with Mr. Grey's wealth. No. It's much more than that folks. It's for the same reason that Ariana Grande's song, \"The Way,\" shot up to #1. And I quote lyrics from the forementioned song, \"He's a bad boy, I must admit it. He got my heart, don't know how he did it!!!\" \n",
      " Women love bad boys! Why do you think Meg Ryan left her then husband, Dennis Quaid, for notorious bad boy Russell Crowe??? Come on! Admit it! Most women fantasize about making whoopie with THE ultimate bad boy. For those of us who can admit it, the fantasy of hair being pulled, of being restrained and forced to whine, moan, plead and possibly scream... \n",
      " Ahem! Okay, here's a question. If you had to choose between a nice, quiet, ever so tender guy and a bad boy who can rock your world like there's no tomorrow, who will you choose? \n",
      " Let's turn to Mr. Grey, shall we? Blonde. A hunk. Authoritative. I imagine just looking at his hands and you'll know he can give your fanny a good little hiding. He's confident to the point of having narcissistic personality disorder. Don't knock insanity, people. It's usually the ones we count off as insane who love the hardest, hold you in their arms the strongest and would truly give his life to save yours if the need arose. Christian Grey makes Ana feel secure like never before, just what she needs now in this new chapter of her life. You know the type of guy I'm talking about, right? Yes, the ones who are so bad you stare at their LOYAL girlfriends who have been with them for too many years and wonder why she's in the relationship? Well, I'll tell you the secret. He is, as the rapper say, knocking the soles off her boots!! Now back to Mr. Grey. Or should we refer to him as Sir? He's a take charge type of guy, who, in his own way, show a level of strength that a lot of women can identify with. by this point in the book, you've read enough about Ana's background where you're hoping and waiting for the two of them to get together. But I'll tell you this. If Anastasia didn't want him, I would have jumped inside the book and say in my most sexiest voice, \"Mr. Grey, here I am, baby. Use me!\" \n",
      " Why not? A little spanking doesn't hurt anyone and the little lifestyle mentioned in this little diddy is right up my... Okay, lemme move on. \n",
      " Sex, sex and more sex, of course, is the driving point of this book. It's the reason some folks labeled it Mommy Porn. But it's more than that for the millions of us who liked the book. What keeps you reading is mish-mashing personality wars between Ana and Sir. Will they get together? Will they break up? Tension is good for any genre, especially romantic novels. And sex sells. Ask a hooker and the men who patron her. I'm an author of thriller/suspense. I throw some good erotica into each of my books, because I love writing from the point of view of a woman. I'm a Lee Child fan or was. Hey, Lee! Can Reacher get a little action every now and again? I mean, he's out saving the world one small town after another. Is he a priest or what? A little jump in the sack for this guy would me this woman reader a lot more happier. Anyhow, back to the point I was making. The feedback I get from my readers? Men tell me to include more murders/killing (mind you there are over a dozen in one novel alone and still they say MORE!) Women? Because of women my novels have reached the Amazon Bestsellers (top 100) an impressive three times for a little Indie author as myself. And I quote one of my true fans, \"Shelley, even more sex in the next one!!!\" Ahem! My main characters are burning holes through pages at a time and still more sex??? Yes! Because WOMEN believe in true love, and what it does to the body and the mind. \n",
      " I give 50 Shades of Grey 5 stars, because E.L. James gave us an original storyline (well, not really, but she introduced a lot of innocent women to BDSM) of one hunky bad guy, one innocent feline needing saving, all to be read in a 'very' entertaining sort of way. The book does what a good book should: keep you interested, get you talking about it to friends, relatives, strangers, cashiers, gas attendants you will never run into again, AND the book has you asking for more. If she doesn't deserve 5 stars on that premise alone, the rest of us writers can pack it up and go home. Most of her books sold from word of mouth, people. That fact alone deserves 5 stars and nothing less.\n",

      "For anyone living under a rock, the Shades of Grey trilogy is an international publishing sensation. Originating from a bit of Twilight fanfic, Fifty Shades of Grey has gone on to become a New York Times #1 bestseller, despite it being classified as erotic fiction. You know, the type that is typically shelved up in the Anonymous section at the start of general fiction way, WAY up on the top shelf. \n",
      " Now I have a confession, I originally had no interest or intent on reading this book. When speaking with my Mom, she kept mentioning how her book group was all a titter about the book and she hadn't read it yet. I tracked down a copy of the ebook and sent it to her, chuckling that I'd just sent my mother porn. Then the reality set it: \n",
      " I just sent my mother porn!?! \n",
      " So, you see, I had to read the book to see exactly what I had done. \n",
      " The plot is pretty simple: A young and naive college student named Anastasia Steele does her ill roommate a favour and covers a life changing interview with billionaire entrepreneur, Christian Grey. Making quite an impression on Grey, he persues Steele ultimately reviling himself to be a dominant in the BDSM world looking to make her his newest submissive. If she agrees, she needs to sign a contract thereby codifying their fledgling relationship. Naturally she has no experience, in fact she's a college graduating virgin at the start of the novel, and has to question what she wants out of a relationship and her willingness to take a walk on the wild side. As the initial book out of a trilogy, it ends on a cliffhanger. \n",
      " The book isn't very well written. The characters are pretty one dimensional and exceptionally insipid. The dialogue, especially Anastasia's self reflective discussions with her inner goddess through most of the novel, is truly diabolical. There are all sorts of reports of women reading passages out loud to their partners to spur a shake up of their sex life. I read passages out loud to mine boyfriend so we could both howl with laughter at it's ludicrousness. \n",
      " The two things that has everyone babbling are the sex scenes and the feminist take on the material. So, let's dispense with the sex first. It's BDSM lite. All talk, little follow through. Grey spanks Steele a few times and makes her go to dinner without her nickers once. Otherwise, it's pretty much just two people having lots of sex, some more forceful than others, but this is hardly the stuff of the film Secretary or the FAR better written Beauty trilogy by Anne Rice. \n",
      " Between the bouts of sex, we get lots - and I do mean LOTS - of \"what should I do\" drivel from the protagonist. She loves him but his darkness scares her but she can't live without him even though she's only known him for three days nonsense. It's tedium personified and the longer it went on the more it grated an irritated. Now I know this is only the first part in a trilogy and the entire point of the first book was to decide whether to enter into this contractual relationship but really, 528 pages of waffle? Was that really necessary? \n",
      " There's very little intellectual dissection of how the descent into an alternative lifestyle really affects Steele. As a virgin, she has nothing to compare the experience to and is already quite curious. As a narrator, she limits and cheats the reader from any true introspection or the self analysis a good book can cause. The closest we get to introspection is to have a \"but I liked it\" tagged on at the end of her inner goddess monologues. \n",
      " And then there's the feminist empowerment drivel I've seen spread about the net. I'm sorry but anyone claiming this is pro-feminism needs to put back on a bra and rip up their membership card. There is nothing empowering about Steele in the first book. She gives in, easily, to the pursuit of a quasi stalker. She sacrifices herself for a man she barely knows but \"loves deeply\" and without whom she cannot live, without so much as a whiff of self respect. Let's face it, she takes one look at his grey eyes (no I'm not kidding) and his messed up hair and falls, quite literally, flat on her face in front of him. After knowing him for less than a week, she's introducing him to everyone as her boyfriend has all but moved in and is entertaining in the Red Room of Pain. She capitulates to his demands exclusively to satisfy HIS urges in a vain hope of redeeming him from within. And she gets a shiny car out of the deal. And a new wardrobe. And a laptop. And a blackberry. And first class travel. And... you get the point. \n",
      " She wants roses, he wants thorns. She takes the thorns hoping that sometime in the future that will lead to flowers and the pretty vase they come in is fulfilling enough for the time being. Is that really what we're calling feminism in 2012? \n",
      " To it's credit, the book is actually quite funny. Sometimes you laugh with it, more often you laugh at it. Where the book truly excels is in the witty email and text banter between the two characters. We've all been there at the start of a relationship and it captures that excitement and playfulness perfectly. That's the only reason this isn't a one star review. \n",
      " So why is this so popular? To be honest, I'm at a loss to explain it. I guess you could make a thin argument about redemption, prince charming, wounded heroes and swooning heroines. An argument about anything so populist friendly must clearly play to the lowest common denominator. But, I won't. \n",
      " For a book about tittilation, it is a surprisingly boring read. I think reading the other two would be my idea of true punishment. \n",
      " 2/5\n",
      "\n",
      "I initially read this book when it first came out and then just this past month tried to read them again. I'm sorry, I know this series has been very popular and I bought the whole set. But. \n",
      " I hate it! \n",
      " While I do give James credit for the sex scenes, which I admit were enticing, the rest of the book sucks! I feel like the characters were poorly developed and everything was way too far-fetched. I could NOT stand Anastasia AT ALL! \"Oh my.\" \"Crap. Double crap.\" Both got on my nerves. \n",
      " Me and a friend of mine were going to read them as part of our book club and I dropped out because I absolutely dreaded reading it! Life is too short to read books you don't get excited about. Fifty Shades just did not do it for me enough to plough through it again. \n",
      " I gave the set away.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I read it. It was pretty bad, but then I knew it would be. Charlie Hunnam will do just fine as Christian. That's all I have to say about that.\n",

      "People need to ease up on this book. People complain about all the sex and the explicitness and ridiculousness of it all but really what were they expecting from an s&m adult novel? \n",
      " Yes Anastasia can be a bit frustrating at times, but in this day and age it's hard to find a female lead, hell, any lead really that won't frustrate you at least a little. \n",
      " It was a quick and easy fun read, that has a lot of fun moments and, well, Christian Grey. \n",
      " Its basically a romance novel. a bit of a strange one I'll admit, but It never claimed to be anything that it wasn't. I'm not sure what kind of literary masterpiece people who were disappointed in it expected it to be, but everyone just needs to piss off. If you didn't like it, then it probably wasn't your kind of book. If its not your kind of book, then why are you reading it?\n",

      "A beautiful love story at its core and well developed characters. Have never read much in the erotic category but the story really enthralls you. A multi gazillion, tortured and damaged hero and an insecure heroine is really a heady combination.

From the beginning I was in awe and hooked. Just when I thought it was coming to an end and slowing down it picked right back up and took an incredible turn. I cannot wait to read the next book and find out more secrets and feel more passion. I would recommend this to women in their 20's 30's or 40's.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is easily one of the worst books I've ever read. All of the characters in this book are extremely annoying and over the top. Christian grey is the most controlling, creepy asshole I've ever seen in a fictional character and it's actually bizarre to me how women find him attractive. He's disgusting. This book is so overrated and it's literally garbage, I couldn't bring myself to finish it because it was so repetitive and ridiculous. Don't even waste your time on this one.\n",

I do not know what came over me that i picked up this book (may be after i saw the trailer), but it was such a disappointment. There is nothing original about the book. Too much resemblance to Twilight. Some dialogues are outright copied from J D robb. The storyline is a joke. The characters are also not very original. Seems the author thought lots of hot scenes are enough to make a bestseller, nd stupid teenagers proved it true!!!!\n",

      "Didn't like it. Christian grey kinda scares me tbh.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I started reading this book, it didn't occur to me that I would be reading a BDSM book. My friends made me picked-up this, they all loved Christian Grey so I didn't bother to check out other book reviews. \n",
      " I enjoyed reading the first quarter of the story. The plot and characters sound familiar (Twilight-y), but then again, I'm having a good time reading the story so I didn't care. However when the contract was revealed, and a few more chapters after that, from then on, I decided I can't continue to read further. I had to look for the reviews in Amazon to make sure I'm labeling this book right. So yes, this is indeed a BDSM book and I don't read that genre. I'm just not into it. I even had to give up reading my favorite Anita Blake series for the same reason. \n",
      " I can understand why this became a controversial read. Just imagine Twilight (Edward as Christian Grey and Bela as Anastasia Steele) add porn and you now have an idea what this book is all about.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would rate this book if I could have gotten through reading it. I don't think it's fair to rate it, not having completed it. I do, however, find it entirely fair to review it. I can say that what I read was terribly written, underwhelming in plot, and vaguely BDSM. I will not read anything else from this author.\n",
      "\n",
      "sex every which away and not the most interesting storyline sums up this book. the ending of this book is the best part. that's when the protagonist gets her brains back. as there is a 2nd and 3rd book in this series means she will lose her wits again, have lots more sex and on and on we go.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was unsure of what to rate this book. It definitely intoxicated me. I expected not to like it, but I'm a bookie and it was all the rage, so I asked for it for Christmas. I started reading it Friday and I finished early today. The writing of the book wasn't very good, but it didn't really matter because it effected me so. There were a lot of things that bothered me about this book. I hated the interview Ana gave Christian bc I am a journalist and that shit would never fly to an editor. She barely got any info. I also hated how played up her innocence was. When they were talking and he asks a question the is removed from the previous topic, and she gets all surprised. I get that she's never really talked to a guy \"like that\" before, but she's talked to other humans surely, and there are a lot of people, myself included who meander in conversation. \n",
      " The sex and Christian's overall effect is really the meat of this book. It's what makes it such a page turner. I've seen some other reviews about this setting back feminism so many years. This book is not trying to send an anti-feminist message. It is an erotic novel, not a future literary classic. Its message is \"f*** me!\" The book honestly could have been far more degrading toward a submissive. BDSM can get a lot more hardcore than this book even begins to describe. Also, to be fair, there are men that are stalkers and crazy like Christian and there are woman that like that. Sex and arousal are different for everyone. \n",
      " All in all, though not well-written, this book definitely made me want to be at the other end of that riding crop and I think that's the key of any fantasy novel is the desire to be the main character or the be in the world that author created.\n",

      "Considering that this book has recently been banned in some loactions, I had to give it a try and it finally became available at the library. \n",
      " Overall, the story was pretty and became better as the plot progressed. I liked Ana and liked her more as she began to assert her personality. Christian is an interesting character. His controlling behavior is very off putting but he has a funny side and it is easy to see how Ana would be attracted to him. I really liked the email pieces, these were clever and entertaining to read. \n",
      " I did have a few issues with the book which is why it does not get a higher rating from me. The thing that annoyed me most is that Ana is 21-22 yet has never been attracted to a guy, ever. Christian is the first man she is attracted to. There are several male characters that seem to like her and it is obvious that she is pretty so this wasn't just because no one was attracted to her. The idea that she had never been attracted to a guy before was just absurd to me. Really, 22 years and never attracted to anyone? I feel like Ana's innnocence could have been explained in a way that wasn't so silly. \n",
      " The sex has to be mentioned since it is an important part of the book. The first few scenes were interesting, but it was kind of boring after a while. Despite changes in scenery or actions, it felt very reptetive. The same lines were said over and over again in slightly different ways and Ana always reacted the same. I am actually surprised at the controversy over these books. I have read PNR books that had racier scenes than this and they are not all considered erotica, just PNR. \n",
      " I have to say this, but since it might make someone think about this a lot while they are reading it I will hide it. I read a review that described this as fanfiction (they didn't name the book though) and once I read that all I could think was that this book had an adult Twilight feel to it, wihout the sparkly vampires. There were a lot of strange similarities to that series. \n",
      " The book concluded in an interesting way and I am intrigued enough to read the second book once it becomes available from the library. I definitely would not pay to read this series.\n",
      "\n",

      " I have never been more angry with a book in my life. Not because of the characters. They don't deserve any of my emotions wasted on them. Really. But how could an author possibly publish such a thing and than make so much money of it?! This story screams sexually unsatisfied desperate housewife. And she is a journalist?! Really? With this dictionary of hers I could think she is a tomato seller and nothing more. She takes a vampire story, changes nothing, twists it in some mind sickening way, pretends to write for a BDSM lifestyle and sells it. It's just offending. And the most offending thing is that there are so many fans and so many crazy about Christian women that make me ask the very honest question \"What the f*ck?!\" And then I have to remember that this book is called \"mommy porn\" on purpose. And here I am a mommy, a housewife with some spare time, reading this literary diarrhea and wondering what the hell is wrong with me and I don't like it? Before picking up this book I didn't read any reviews, I didn't ask questions what is it about. I just started. And with every line I felt like reading Twilight again. This big secret he was hiding... I was expecting him any moment to turn and say \"Hey, I'm a vampire, no biggie\". Oh, I'd rather read something like that and not that dirty little secret of his. I mean BDSM is not so twisted, although it's definitely not my style. But I felt like giving E.L.James a dictionary and a stack of porn DVDs so she can get the real idea of what exactly BDSM is and then write about it. \n",
      " I didn't make it to the end. At some point I decided I got enough from Anastasia's naivety and blatant stupidity and from Christian's twisted little games and contracts, and threw the book in the blackest hole on my hard disk. Thank God, a friend lend it to me and I didn't waste any money on it, because that would have gotten me really angry. After throwing the book and swearing to God and baby Jesus I will never EVER again read a single phrase from this author, I found an interview with her, where she says the only thing she fears is her children reading the book! WHY THE FUCK DID YOU PUBLISH IT THEN?!?!?! \n",

      "\n",
      "Wow, this book! I discovered the book on Amazon, and was immediately interested. I was interested for two reasons: one, because the love story sounded so interesting, and two, most everyone who read it compared it to Twilight in some way. Which throws me because Twilight is not the basis of comparison for everything in the universe. \n",
      " Anastasia Steele fills in for her best friend when she's too sick to attend her interview for their college newspaper, and definitely gets a lot more than she expects.

But then he keeps showing up everywhere she goes. Curious as to why he's so brooding and controlling, she soon finds out his dark secret. \n",
      " This is definitely erotic romance, which is something I don't read, but the initial story was what drew me in. I really enjoy the main character, Anastasia Steele. I love that she's extremely innocent and seems to question everything. I found myself relating to her in many ways throughout the story. She has self-esteem issues, real issues we deal with everyday which makes the story believable, and I really like that. And I like the ending of the book as well because it is so fitting. It's not a happy ending, but that's okay because it leads perfectly into the next book. I'm very excited to read the next book and see what happens. I have a pretty good idea of what will happen because I read numerous reviews to get me pumped for the books, but I cannot wait to see how it all falls together.\n",

For Ana graduating was days away but first she need to interview Christian Grey, who she knows nothing about, is asked by her best friend for a simple favor. Turned out the guy who both intrigued and irritated her was Mr. Grey who is one fine piece of, I mean good looking man who kept insisting wasn't good for Ana but kept showing up. If the universe keeps sending him to her what, is she supposed to ignore him, of course not. Of course Christian has a couple of rules she must follow if she wants to keep seeing him. One of them being that he wants a BDSM arrangement and of course with her consent to be the dominant one. Another rule is to not touch him on his chest, even though its tempting she must restrain or else suffer the consequences if or when she does. \n",
      " Because he is type that screams dominant, Ana can't hope for something more by the end, what she didn't expect was to enjoy being in this type of relationship. She also didn't expect to keep wanting more and more she got. Christian of course showed the qualities any man can easily have but with is weird obsession with sex and how it needs to be done, is kinda scaring Ana out. She has to many rules to follow and he keeps giving her things she insist are loan, she knows deep down she cares for him. But when things get to the point of wanting/ needing more Ana realizes that the man she cares deeply is just showing her the basics of his world to her and barely giving her a taste of what he really wants. What he wants is actually so crazy and scary Ana has no idea the pain she put herself through it being physical or mental its still hurts the same. \n",
      " The idea for this story definitely intrigued me, of course Christian Grey is the type of man who dominates every aspect of any man I've ever read before. For Ana to fall for him was easy because he showed her himself, even though that type comes with contracts and of course gifts. Ana has to know that by the end she will have a different view on life. Christian cares enough, I also fell for him as well, its just crazy to think he can be so gentle but also want for her to fell pain. I loved the overall book and couldn't help wanting more. He is so menacing but also he is kind and cares deeply. While reading there where moments that had me sigh because his character for me gave a sense that Christian can possible change his ways. He started too it seemed, but he wanted more of Ana. Which is something she knew she couldn't give him. The second one keeps staring at me to read and demolish one weekend and start the third but for now the thought of getting more Christian has me sighing even more.

      "Fifty Shades of Grey is not that type of book I usually read. I had to really think that how many stars I give to this book and I ended up to 5 stars. The most biggest reason is very clear to me. I just found this book extremely addictive (read in two days), funny and just damn interesting. to be honest, I loved it. \n",
      " I have heard so bad reviews of this book and many people judge people who likes this book. Anastasia, main character... So many this book's reader see her as a victim. There was few moments I kinda felt sorry for her but I still knew that she definitely wasn't a victim. She made her own choices and Christian made very clear to her that she could stop their relationship if she wanted. And gosh, Ana is a adult and if someone wants to join that kind of lifestyle Christian has, then let them join. It should not be anyone else's problem. But this book is pure fiction and people are too harsh to it. \n",
      " I like the way E. L. James write. She is great author and I seriously can't wait to read more her books. And I really want to know more about Christian's earlier life and reasons why he ended up doing BDSM. Okay and cliffhanger in the end... I'll go now and search my copy of second book and start reading it right away after the first. \n",
      " I enjoyed this book a lot but not in that way someone might think...\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes 2 stars. I've NEVER ever given such a rating before. I'm very easy to please, I can always find something to enjoy in a book...if I can't then I usually DNF it. If gets 2 stars instead of 1 because it made me laugh a few times (mostly the email exchanges). \n",
      " I only read this book because I felt forced to do it. I swore I would never read them, but my colleague at work are all so excited and raving about this series I was more than annoyed not to be heard because 'I haven't read it so I can't know and I would probably like it if I did' Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah OMFG that made me so angry I broke my promise to myself and decided to read it. \n",
      " Now that I've read it, I have an even worse opinion of this series. I knew it would be bad but I thought maybe it wouldn't be THAT bad. I have never ever felt so much like violence reading a book, the heroine is just WAY TSTL. That doesn't even cover it. She's not alone in her head for sure, She, her subconscious and the inner goddess are just plain crazy. I will not go into details about how bad this is, I think it's been covered before. \n",
      " I'm just now reassured that, I was right in my opinions and I can keep the battle with my colleagues now. I'm pretty sure the only reason they love it so much is because they haven't read any better. Most of them aren't even readers, they were surprised they read the first book in ONLY 1 month. O_o I guess I must have felt the same way when I first read Twilight years ago...I'd never read anything like it, it was so new so exciting. When I reread them a few years later I was appalled. It's all a question of perspective I guess, maybe if they read better stuff they'd realize how bad this is. \n",
      " It's kinda sad because the concept of this story could have worked. I actually 'liked' Christian on some occasions. If it had been written properly maybe it would have worked. \n",
      " Reading a book is like watching a movie, you want to feel absorbed by the story you don't want to be reminded you're reading something. I couldn't 'enjoy' the story because i got so annoyed at the writing. There is no subtlety here, everything is being pushed so that you get what the author wants you to get. How many times does she have to do the 'EAT your food' scene??? We get it, he has had a bad childhood starving. You don't need to repeat that same scene 100 times. Aaaaaanyway, if that's not bad enough the ending was so appalling I'm tempted to give back a star. \n",
      " It's a good thing I was currently reading 2 other GOOD books while reading this one.\n",
      "\n",
      "I loved this book. I love the interaction of the two main characters and I am in love with Christian. I skimmed over the sex scenes because I wanted to get to know the characters beyond that. Love love. I want more.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hate-read this with some other friends. The most shocking part is just how appallingly bad the writing is. Like what you like, I don't care if you read the trashiest of novels, but the writing in this was just horrific. I am astonished that this was published by a major publisher without editing. There was absolutely none. I know someone else here counted how many times the protagonist said/thought \"crap\", \"jeez\", and \"holy ___\" and the number was astoundingly high. \n",
      " Not to mention the awful abusive and stalker behavior of Christian Grey.Personally speaking, I don't think the words \"sexy\" and \"stalker\" are desirable and they do not go together. \n",
      " Aside from that, the book was just boring. Nothing really happened. The main character was as bland as bland can be, the sex scenes were unintentionally hilarious-and again, it's because the WRITING is SO, SO, bad. \n",
      " I needed a palate cleanser after this. \n",
      " I am not an expert in romance type of novels, but I feel like a quick search in a library catalog (or talking to a librarian!) would yield better stuff than this. Appalling. A shameful piece of dreck that really just is an embarrassment to the publishing industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if I overlook the mediocre syntax and grammar, this book just did not do it for me. While it might be an interesting fanfiction, how did this become a bestseller? Ana comes across initially as an intelligent down-to-earth woman and I am intrigued by the dilemma she must face when she is awakened sexually into Grey's world. But then it all goes downhill. What I thought would be a great tension builder and interesting plot line exploring a virginal woman's view of the BDSM culture became boring sex scene after boring sex scene with no plot in between. If fact, Ana seems to change into the stereotypical dumb heroine after the first few chapters. She has serious questions and doubts that she wants addressed, but instead of either getting them addressed or showing understanding that the answers must wait for a more appropriate time--sex scene. But wait, I still have doubts so now I feel bad, now Grey's upset, but...nevermind, sex scene. The book consist of minimal plot, minimal world building, minimal character development, no sexual tension, minimal intrigue, and unimaginative and vanilla sex scenes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Was there a repetition of a scene or was that just my idea?\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, I have sold probably a hundred copies of this book, and I did not notice that's a tie on the cover until after I finished reading it. How observant am I? As far as the actual book, much like Ana, I have contrasting feelings. I like the plot. It resonates with me. In another of my favorite series, a character with a haunting past resorts to these kinds of relationships. I like that books like this humanize what is generally seen as monstrous behavior. Coming from a bad place can take people to bad places without making them bad people. I approve of that message. The adult scenes are very descriptive, but not as disturbing as you'd think. It did not go to the uncomfortable depths I'd been led to believe. On the other hand, the prose can get repetitive. I get that Ana's thoughts are repetitive because she's going over the same thing again and again trying to make herself okay with it. It's that the same words and phrases are used so often, and it makes me a little bonkers. As long as you're not looking for the next great American novel, though, it's a compelling, fast read with a worthwhile theme.\n",
      "\n",
      "Can you do absence of any trace of stars? Because I would. \n",
      " So, it's sado-maso-bondage storytelling....therein does not lie the problem at all. \n",
      " The writing simply is bad. \n",
      " The bad part being, the point of view which is completely and utterly askew, off topic, displaced and ridiculous. The author uses \"I\". I do this, I do that, I am obsessing about a man while masterbating. So what? That would be fine if the \"I\" in question used the appropriate style of conversation, and the vocabulary commonly in use by the person purportedly being the \"I\". Follow me? No? \n",
      " Ok, the primary character is supposed to be a fresh outta college timid girl from Washington State. If so, then why does she sound suspiciously like a middle aged woman from England heavily into an alternative sex scene in view of livening things up at home because both herself and the hubby have become bored silly with each other? Just sayin'... \n",
      " The content is what it is, and I could care less. It's the writing thing that gets me red-faced and grouchy.... \n",
      " ....and seriously? \"the red room of pain\"...? Pffftttt! Every college grad's dream of how to hook the right man...\n",
      "\n",
      "I've decided that I would review the first and second book together. I love love love love. There are flaws in the books like many other books but I love the feel and the characters. Let's just start out and say that Christian Grey is the best thing about thing ever. Without him it would be nothing. I like Anastasia too- they compliment each other nicely. But the worse thing and most painful about the two first books so far is the lack of plot and extensive, unnecessary writing. This book could have been 200 pages shorter and we would still get the same feel for the characters and plot. I often found myself skimming or even skipping pages because Anastasia would just be repeating her thoughts that I already knew she felt. There are good highlighting points of the plot but it gets lost in the rest of her bs going in in her head. However, I love the story that is there, is just needs to be cleaned up.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I started this book I had low expectations. But what a wonderful story of two people who have their own issues and upbringing getting together and trying to be better together, I expected a lot more sex then there was and that's one reason I thought I wouldn't like it. This is more for older women,the younger may not understand the nuance. So if you expect lots of sex and D&s,you will be disappointed. Almost gave it 5 stars but want to see what the rest of the books are like.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book was the biggest disappointment. \n",
      " Knowing that the author originally wrote this as a Twilight Fan Fiction, I got excited because I love Twilight and I love it when people make current characters their own and make their own stories. \n",
      " This was a let down. \n",
      " The sex was mediocre, Grey was nothing like Edward, even though Anastasia was exactly like Bella. \n",
      " It lacked character development and definitely lacked a viable plot. I felt that too much went into the contract between steele and grey and that there wasnt enough give and take with them. it was mostly take take take from grey and no give from him. with Anastasia being picky as hell. \n",
      " It was just annoying. Not the best read but definitely not the worst either.\n",
      "\n",
      "I liked the book. Not brilliantly written, but when you consider the crap that is in most of the highly rated, gushed over book lists of most of the people giving this book a 1 star review, you begin to realize the hate this book gets has nothing to do with the book itself but everything to do with this idiotic bandwagon mentality people have developed to bash it. I mean, geesh, you read some of these silly reviews and you assume the author personally offended the reader somehow. Just nonsense. I'm not a lemming so I just tell it like it is. The story line isn't brilliant or all that original, but the story is interesting and emotional and sexy. To me. I can't wait for the film. My man and I will be front and center.\n",
      "\n",
      "Add me to the list of \"eh.\" I might have been biased from the start since I knew the origins of this story, but I thought the beginning was pretty poorly written. Lots of telling, not showing, and I didn't get the initial attraction at all. It did pick up once their relationship started but I did not like Christian at all and didn't care that much about Ana.\n",
      "\n",
      "I read it because of all the talk about it and am disappointed that so many people would consider this to be a good read. Horrible writing, weak character development and repetitive descriptions...blah. There are plenty of well written, fabulous books out there with steamy scenes. Save yourself the time of reading this book and go rent some cheap porn.\n",
      "\n",
      "I put off reading this for so long because I don't usually like all the hype. Sure, it was graphic, but there are more graphic scenes in other novels I've read. I like how Ana struggles with herself throughout and how she tries to be who he wants her to be. It seems so honest and the ending is exactly what I wanted. Grey seems like such a mystery. I don't really see why all these women are hot for him, but he's depraved and fascinating.\n",
      "\n",
      "behind the porn there is a beautiful story\n",

      "I am not into BDSM at all, never excited me or interested me. \n",
      " So I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed this series. \n",
      " I can see now why ladies fall for C Grey, he is impossible but at the same time so damn interesting. \n",
      " I must admit that I only kept reading this book because of the e-mail conversation between the main characters. It was funny and care free unlike those to face to face, which was way too intense. \n",
      " The writing however was kinda poor....using words like \"Jeez\" and \"wow he is so hot\" is okay for the likes of us who know nothing about writing but not so okay for a published author. \n",
      " But I enjoyed reading this easy read book.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.75 I really enjoyed it because Grey reminded me of Chuck Bass. but I can't give it 4 stars idk\n",
      "\n",
      "Possibly one of the worst books I've ever had the displeasure of reading. I'm going to keep this short, reasons why I hate this novel, the repetitiveness, e.g. 'I flushed' used 5 times in 3 pages, constantly personifying her 'inner goddess' and subconscious not to mention the general lack of plot. Terrible sex which is terribly written. Kicking myself that I wasted my time reading it just because everyone else was. Simply awful writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ok totally unfair that they leave you hanging at the end ... I didn't want to like this book, totally not my style, horrible writing but yet I wanted to know how it would end up ... And yes I just might read the next one and be embarrassed of the fact!\n",
      "\n",
      "I enjoyed this series for what it was. A lot of smut (which my husband didn't mind *wink, wink*) but also for a decent story line of two disturbed individuals that find a love that may not make sense to others looking in from the outside. \n",
      " I think the fact that there was a lot of defiance was my favorite part! \n",

      "I absolutely hate it so far...and I'm up to page 81. I really can't get past the voice of it being in the present tense. The main character is totally annoying. I've already broken my own rule...if I still hate it by page 50, I stop reading it. But my friend lent it to me....and she loved it....and she'll be crushed if I tell her I hate it and am not finishing it. But what do I care? She hated Outlander...and didn't finish it. So I guess that makes us even? \n",
      " Never finished it...I'd give it a big 'MEH'! Hated the writing, the female characters, and the idea that I might be missing something really good if I stuck with it. But what the hay, I gave it back to my friend and confessed that I never finished it; in fact, I confessed, I only got to page 81. She was horrified, and I was relieved that I could move on to a different book. I'm way too old to waste my time reading books I hate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Curiosity killed the cat and is also responsible for me reading this book. This book has opened my eyes, prior to reading it, I assumed that all books needed to have a plot, I was proven wrong. This book rambles on and on for over 500 pages until finally our heroine, Miss Steele reaches the \"revelation\" that the reader has been well aware of since about page 75. \n",
      " In a book with so many carnal climaxes I find it ironic that there is no real literary apex. Instead, the reader is punished several times over by listening to the same conversations over and over and over and over.... \n",
      " Not only was the plot nonexistent, and the characters flat, but the writing itself is one big disaster. This story is supposed to take place in Seattle, yet all of the characters speak like they grew up in London, England. The sentence structure, terminology and phrases all echo of Great Britain, even the tea drinking! I get it the author is British and doesn't know a damn thing about Seattle, then change the setting and save yourself the embarrassment. \n",
      " Lastly, this is a completely personal observation. I find it truly sad that women would find a character like Christian Grey to be alluring in any sense. I think it is sad that I am supposed to fawn over their shallow physical relationship and wish it were mine. I find it disgusting that a female author has written into existence such a weak and stupid character that can only melt and wilt, even Bella Swan had more backbone. I find it insulting that the last 10 pages of this book are supposed to be empowering when I know that they are merely setting up a sequel. This book is an atrocious statement about our culture's skewed vision on love and relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wow. Just...Wow.\n",

      "It got a second star for the e-mails. Those were definitely worth reading. James dialogue isn't too bad, but her descriptions are god awful. Also, I read enough about Ana's inner goddess that I wanted to scream. The sex scenes are pretty decent, but the woman needs some writing classes.\n",

      " But seriously, everyone - stop over-analyzing this book. People keep saying that just like Twilight, this is teaching girls that it's okay to be in abusive relationships and a whole bunch of rigmarole. To them I ask - why would you ever let a 15-year-old read this? Maybe you should put this book down and pick up a parenting one. Or something about self-esteem. \n",
      " Nothing about the book is remotely realistic, and about 95% of it is beyond absurd. But that's half its charm. I took this to the beach with me and couldn't have picked a better mindless read. I'm already on the third book after five days and I'm not even a little ashamed. Embarrassed to read it in public, maybe. But whatever. I was incredibly sunburned to the point I needed to get a steroid shot, so anything to take my mind off the pain was A-OK with me. \n",
      " Look, it's not a serious novella. It's not Jane Austen or Victor Hugo, nor is it a modern classic. Let's stop treating it as if it was meant for greatness. It's pure tripe that's fun to read every now and then, just like its inspiration.\n",

      " I have very strong feelings about this series. Bear with me and take what I say with a grain of salt. \n",
      " 50SG started as Master of the Universe (MotU) in the Twilight fanfiction community. It was a decent fic. Not great, but also not terrible like some of the drivel out there. There wasn't a lot of character development, but it didn't matter because everyone knew who Edward, Bella, and the other characters were. The sex scenes weren't as hot as one of the other popular BDSM fics (tarasueme's The Submissive trilogy), but it was a surprisingly compelling read. And for a Twific, that's fine. It doesn't have to be a well-written story, because a lot is already assumed by the readers. \n",
      " What I have a problem with, since MotU became 50SG: \n",
      " * Twilight fanfic (or any fandom's fic) is written BY people who love the series FOR people who love the series. A series that was written by Stephanie Meyer. She owns the Intellectual Property. Illegal? Maybe not. Ethical? I don't think so. \n",
      " * This whole pull-to-publish phenomenon--while not exclusive to the Twi fandom--has caused a split in the community. While I realize this doesn't matter to people outside of the fandom, it has affected a lot of people. \n",
      " * James made very few changes in a work that was previously posted on-line. For free. Which you can still download today, rather than pay $30. \n",
      " * The writing is juvenile. It's fine in fanfic, but as a published book? No. Just no. \n",
      " * James portrays BDSM in a negative light, with Bella/Ana talking about how she can change him and bring him out of the darkness. BDSM is about sexual pleasure; it's not this awful, painful experience that's going to drag you down into hell. \n",
      " * We are introduced to two Doms: 1) Edward/Christian, who was abused as a child and has mommy issues that cause him to play with subs who LOOK LIKE HIS MOTHER; and 2) Mrs. Robinson, a PEDOPHILE who started a D/s relationship with a FIFTEEN-year-old BOY. A boy who was acting out because he was abused and needed professional help. If it had been a middle-aged man taking on an abused fifteen-year-old girl as a sexual submissive, dude would have been arrested and branded a sex offender. \n",
      " * BDSM is used as an excuse for Edward/Christian to be a domineering, controlling asshole. And Bella/Ana just accepts this. \n",
      " * A 21-year-old college graduate without an e-mail address? Really? \n",
      " * Edward/Christian buys the company that Bella/Ana goes to work for so he can keep an eye on her. Really? Really? \n",
      " * Edward/Christian is a 27-year-old billionaire who never seems to do any actual work. Entrepreneurs and C-level executives work all.the.time in real life. \n",
      " * The term \"mommy porn\" is ridiculous. Porn is porn. You know what I think mommy porn is? A hot guy to watch my kids and clean my house while I go to the spa. \n",
      " I'll stop. I could go on and on and on. \n",
      " On a positive note (you didn't think there would be one, did you?), I have to give the book credit for bringing female sexuality to the mainstream. Yay for women embracing their own desires!\n",

      "\n",
      "Book club choice so I guess its time to see what all the hype is about.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll be honest, I read this book because of all the hoopla going on around it(yeah, yeah I admit to my fear of missing out). I was not expecting \"great literature\" but still I was surprised as to how average it was, typical of a low quality romance novel. Rich man falls for average virginal 21-year old girl (with the maturity of a 12 year old). Average girl falls in love with creepy, rich and overly possesive man. The plot is cliche in mediocre prose, repeating the same thing over and over. (\"oh my,\" \" crap,\" \"lip biting\".) Who knew reading about BDSM sex would be such a bore? \n",
      " Probably I wouldn't have rated this book so low, but I strongly dislike weak characters in novels. And after a couple of pages I was just about ready to shake Ana and her Inner Goddess.(and I am usually a non violent person) Christian, is also a very unlikeable character, arrogant, overly self-important and ridiculously irritating. He has no redeeming qualities at all except for being good looking and filthily rich.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay if you follow me on Twitter you know that I have been discussing this book. People say its like Twilight, no it wasn't for me... Because from early on I was team Jacob. There was no Jacob for me in this book, I just really liked Christian from the get go. I am a big contemporary romance fan, so I'm used to adult relations, and I've read Outlander & The Black Dagger Brotherhood, so my morals are pretty lose. Plus its obvious Christian is the way he is because of something. I found Ana to be understanding but in a realistic way, she wasn't a total idiot about the situation. This book was classic Jane Eyre, Beauty & The Beast type of stuff, which I guess so is Twilight in its own way but they had the love triangle, I haven't read the second installment of this book though so someone else could come along. The writing was really upfront for me I liked that and I really liked the e-mails they sent back and forth to each other, it allowed Ana to be more open but in a believable way, because Christian is intimidating in person. I thought Kate was a good solid best friend. I also thought it had one of the best meet-cutes ever. Her literally falling into his life, that was very Bella. Okay so they are in Washington there are a few similarities. I can understand why some of the content might be off-putting its just not an issue for me sex has never really scandalized me much in books or TV. The love story itself was more troubling because I felt Ana and Christian changing and he warned her (okay very Edward) to stay away, its starting to sink in now ha-ha.\n",

      "Now, having read this, I'm of the opinion that the rampant success of this book is primarily due to its fan-fiction status. The writing itself is utilitarian at best, the dialogue was not great, and it quickly becomes evident that the author is British-writing-American. (Americans aren't widely known for using words like pram and keen.) The plotting holds up ok, but that's because Stephenie Meyer had the benefit of a professional editor, which this book could really have used. It has a component of BDSM, but i don't believe that's what draws the audience, either. (Regular readers of that kind of erotica would, I imagine, be looking for more. Or so I suspect.) But none of that is responsible for its success. \n",
      " No, I firmly believe that this book is popular because adult readers of Twilight connected very strongly with its characters, and felt a strong desire to re-read the story with some adult content, and what better non-fantasy equivalent to the dangerous vampire than a man who practices BDSM? This book is a way for readers to reconnect with a book they loved in a new and, for many, shocking context. But if you weren't a fan of Twilight the first time around, I don't think there's anything here for you. But hey, you'll probably read it anyway. Everyone else seems to be.\n",

      "Wicked. Dangerous. Definitely for 18+. Christian oh Christian...\n",

      "Straight XXX porn. Which is also poorly written.\n",
      "\n",
      "K, who could read this and not love this book!? A falling in love story, a rich good looking guy story, a hot steamy sex story. . . . . . I repeat, how could you not love it!? \n",
      " I have read that in some libraries in the U.S. there was talk of it being banned. I could easily see a high school library banning it but I find it sad that government thinks they can stop the public from reading what they want. Especially as it's not hurting anyone. Sigh. \n",
      " I couldn't wait to begin the second book.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's certainly not the best literature out there, and it's not very well written, but...it's a good choice if you're looking for a new guilty pleasure or some trashy beach reading. If you don't like erotic or overly sensual description though, this book will make you very uncomfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fifty shades of poor writing. I was given this as a gift, so did try to get through it, but just couldn't. The plot was boring, the characters idiots, the grammar was horrid, and the linguistic style was . . . wait, there was no style.\n",
      "\n",
      "Honestamente comence a leerme este libro por cuestiones de presion social (es decir que mucha gente me decia que era muy bueno). Aunque nadie sabia decirme en que consistia mas que \"sexo\". A pesar de eso, no quise leer ninguna resena porque pense que era mejor esperar a ver que tal la cosa. \n",
      " Lo comence una vez y me parecio bien pero mi error fue irme a una de las escenas intimas de Anastacia y Christian y senti que no iba a poder con el y lo deje. Pero despues que salio la pelicula un amigo me dijo que tenia que leerlo, que el iba a retomarlos porque quedo en el segundo y me convencio. lo comence de nuevo. \n",
      " Descubri que las personas no son buena referencia .-. si, hay escenas que son eroticas y que te hacen sentir cosas pero ese es el proposito. Pues cumplio su objetivo. Lo que note es que nadie menciona el amor de Christian y Anastacia. Como que es parte de la trama pero las personas lo pasan por alto. Incluso pasan por alto el hecho de que Christian ha pasado por cosas muy fuertes en su ninez y todo eso lo ha llevado a ser como es, a ser quien es y todo eso se ha quedado con el. Hay toda una razon de ser, la cual no se descubre enteramente en este libro, espero en el proximo saber. De hecho puedes quitarle la trama del sadomasoquismo y el sexo e imaginar que es un traficante de drogas y sigues teniendo la misma idea de la historia. \n",
      " Este es un libro en el que un hombre tiene muchos problemas y no sabe como enfrentarlos y prefiere quedarse con lo que ya conoce. Por otro lado, esta la mujer (la narradora no mas) que le da el sentido dulce y tierno a toda esta historia. Y esa es la pieza fundamental. Los dos estan enamorados. Pero el hombre esta muy roto como para poder aceptarlo. Y ella solo esta esperando que el lo haga. Y ella sabe que ese dia puede no llegar pero ella se aferra a esa idea, se aferra a esa pequena ilusion de que si, ese es el hombre de sus suenos y es mas que eso. Porque este hombre es apasionado y tiene un caracter fuerte, pero ella lo acepta por amor. \n",
      " Es interesante ver como este personaje parece tan compuesto y resulta que necesita a alguien que lo componga pero nadie tiene la determinacion y paciencia suficientes para hacerlo. Pero tal vez ella sea la excepcion.\n",
